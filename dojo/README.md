# Dojo Katas and Belts

This directory defines katas (small, concrete exercises) for agents.

Katas are grouped into belts. Each belt is a difficulty band; the belt files describe intent and CLP framing. The kata files define exact actions.

Each kata has its own file named `kata-XX-<short-name>.md`.

## Belt map (high level)

- White Belt – Initial Communication
- Yellow Belt – Comment Handling
- Orange Belt – Loops and Neighborhood
