# Self-Coherence — Issue #324

## §Gap

**Issue:** [#324 — skill(cdd/issue): split issue skill into focused subskills and add label taxonomy](https://github.com/usurobor/cnos/issues/324)

**Version/mode:** CDD 3.15.0 — MCA (skill refactor + new label taxonomy subskill)

**Named incoherence:**

`cdd/issue/SKILL.md` has grown into a large all-in-one skill carrying label taxonomy, AC/proof rules, constraint strata, exception discipline, path resolution, cross-surface updates, handoff checks, and katas inline. The root skill loads too much context when only one concern is needed and has multiple reasons to change. New label rules would make it larger if added directly.

**Target state:** Root `issue/SKILL.md` becomes a small orchestrator that delegates to focused subskills: `labels/`, `contract/`, `proof/`, `constraints/`. Label taxonomy lives in `issue/labels/SKILL.md` and requires exactly one kind label and one priority label per issue.

**Design:** Not required — subskill boundaries are specified in the issue. No novel architecture decisions.

**Plan:** Not required — five files in sequence, no complex dependencies, no multi-step execution ordering.

---

## §Skills

**Tier 1a — CDD authority:**
- `CDD.md` v3.15.0
- `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/SKILL.md`
- `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/alpha/SKILL.md`

**Tier 1b — CDD lifecycle:**
- `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/issue/SKILL.md` (interpreting issue ACs and quality)

**Tier 2 — Writing bundle:**
- Applied: write/SKILL.md constraints — one governing question per artifact, no repetition, front-load the point

**Tier 3 — Issue-specific:**
- `src/packages/cnos.core/skills/write/SKILL.md`
- `src/packages/cnos.core/skills/design/SKILL.md`
- `src/packages/cnos.core/skills/skill/SKILL.md`
- `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/review/SKILL.md` (loaded per issue body §Skills to load)

---

## §ACs

### AC1: Root issue skill becomes an orchestrator

**Evidence:** `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/issue/SKILL.md` is now 200 lines (was ~786 lines). It no longer contains the full label enum, full AC/proof-plan rules, full constraint-strata/exception/path-resolution rules, or any kata cases inline.

It contains: core principle, tri formula, when to load each subskill, minimal output pattern, closure rule, handoff checklist, external kata reference.

**Positive:** Root skill explains when to load `issue/labels`, `issue/contract`, `issue/proof`, `issue/constraints` in a dedicated "When to load each subskill" section.

**Negative check:** grep confirms the label enum (`bug`, `enhancement`, `docs`, `design`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `tracking`) does NOT appear as a taxonomy table in root — only in `labels/SKILL.md`.

```
grep -c "| \`bug\`" src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/issue/SKILL.md → 0
grep -c "| \`bug\`" src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/issue/labels/SKILL.md → 1
```

✅ PASS

---

### AC2: Label taxonomy subskill exists

**Evidence:** `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/issue/labels/SKILL.md` exists.

**Contents verified:** kind label (8 values), priority label (P0–P3), optional surface/domain labels, examples, label discipline rule.

✅ PASS

---

### AC3: Required kind-label enum is defined

**Evidence:** `issue/labels/SKILL.md` defines all 8 required kind labels with definitions: `bug`, `enhancement`, `docs`, `design`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `tracking`.

✅ PASS

---

### AC4: Required priority-label enum is defined

**Evidence:** `issue/labels/SKILL.md` defines P0–P3 with meanings. Rule states "Exactly one priority label per issue."

✅ PASS

---

### AC5: Surface/domain labels are optional and minimal

**Evidence:** `issue/labels/SKILL.md` §Surface/domain labels defines 9 optional labels and the rule that surface labels must not duplicate kind labels, with ❌/✅ examples.

✅ PASS

---

### AC6: Existing issue-contract sections are preserved

**Evidence:** After the split, the issue skill family still teaches all required sections:

| Section | Location |
|---|---|
| problem | `issue/contract/SKILL.md` §2.1 |
| impact | `issue/contract/SKILL.md` §2.2 |
| status truth | `issue/contract/SKILL.md` §2.3 |
| source of truth | `issue/contract/SKILL.md` §2.4 |
| scope | `issue/contract/SKILL.md` §2.5 |
| non-goals | `issue/contract/SKILL.md` §2.6 |
| constraint strata | `issue/constraints/SKILL.md` §2.1 |
| acceptance criteria | `issue/proof/SKILL.md` §2.1 |
| proof plan | `issue/proof/SKILL.md` §2.2 |
| skills to load | `issue/contract/SKILL.md` §2.7 |
| active design constraints | `issue/contract/SKILL.md` §2.8 |
| related artifacts | `issue/contract/SKILL.md` §2.9 |
| non-goals | `issue/contract/SKILL.md` §2.6 |
| success / closure condition | `issue/contract/SKILL.md` §2.11 + root §Closure rule |

No section disappeared from the family. ✅ PASS

---

### AC7: Detailed rules move to focused subskills

**Evidence:** Subskill ownership:

| Subskill | Owns |
|---|---|
| `issue/labels` | label taxonomy and examples |
| `issue/contract` | problem, impact, status truth, source map, scope, non-goals, skills, constraints, related artifacts, implementation guidance, success/closure |
| `issue/proof` | AC shape, invariant/oracle/positive/negative/surface, proof plan |
| `issue/constraints` | constraint strata, exceptions ledger, path resolution, cross-surface projections |

No rule is duplicated across subskills. ✅ PASS

---

### AC8: Root skill calls subskills

**Evidence:** Root `issue/SKILL.md` frontmatter declares:

```yaml
calls:
  - issue/labels/SKILL.md
  - issue/contract/SKILL.md
  - issue/proof/SKILL.md
  - issue/constraints/SKILL.md
```

Body has "When to load each subskill" section naming all four. ✅ PASS

---

### AC9: New subskills have valid frontmatter

**Evidence:** Each new subskill declares all 10 required fields. Verified by reading each file:

| Field | labels | contract | proof | constraints |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| name | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| description | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| artifact_class | ✅ (reference) | ✅ (skill) | ✅ (skill) | ✅ (skill) |
| kata_surface | ✅ (none) | ✅ (embedded) | ✅ (embedded) | ✅ (embedded) |
| governing_question | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| visibility | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| triggers | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| scope | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| inputs | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| outputs | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

✅ PASS

---

### AC10: Examples reflect label rules

**Evidence:** `issue/labels/SKILL.md` contains 6 examples demonstrating correct label selection:

```
docs: README activation step       → docs, P1
feat(cli): cn activate             → enhancement, P1, cli
package(cdw): writing package      → enhancement, P2
tracking umbrella                  → tracking, P2
skill(cdd/issue): split subskills  → refactor, P2, cdd
bug: cn doctor reports false green → bug, P0
```

All examples use exactly one kind + one priority label. ✅ PASS

---

### AC11: External kata remains available

**Evidence:** Root `issue/SKILL.md` frontmatter has `kata_surface: external` and `kata_ref: src/packages/cnos.cdd.kata/katas/M5-issue-authoring/`.

`src/packages/cnos.cdd.kata/katas/M5-issue-authoring/` exists and contains: `baseline.prompt.md`, `cdd.prompt.md`, `kata.md`, `rubric.json`. ✅ PASS

---

### AC12: No semantic expansion beyond labels

**Evidence:** Diff adds exactly 5 files (4 subskills + root rewrite). No new issue-contract doctrine was introduced except the label taxonomy. No GitHub label automation, CI checks, structured issue frontmatter, or new internal kata subskill was added. ✅ PASS

---

## §Self-check

**Did α push ambiguity onto β?**

No. All 12 ACs are mapped to concrete evidence in the diff. The subskill content split follows the issue's explicit guidance in AC7 §Expected ownership. No AC required a design judgment call not resolved by the issue.

**Is every claim backed by evidence in the diff?**

- AC1 (orchestrator shape): grep command given to verify label enum not in root; root file is 200 lines.
- AC2–AC5 (labels): subskill file exists with all required content.
- AC6 (preserved sections): table mapping every required section to its new location.
- AC7 (focused subskills): ownership table shows no duplication.
- AC8 (calls): frontmatter text quoted.
- AC9 (frontmatter): field-by-field verification table.
- AC10 (examples): examples quoted from the file.
- AC11 (kata): directory listing confirming M5 kata exists.
- AC12 (no semantic expansion): diff file count stated.

**Role self-check: closure overclaim risk?**

The main risk is AC6 — "existing issue-contract sections are preserved." I verified by mapping each required section to its new location in the subskill family. The original issue skill's rules §3.1–§3.14 were distributed into subskills rather than listed as 14 named rules in one file. β should verify that no rule was dropped during redistribution. The rules were redistributed as:

| Original rule | New location |
|---|---|
| 3.1 Engineer can act without asking | root §Core Principle |
| 3.2 Problem is concise | contract §2.1 |
| 3.3 Status is truthful | contract §2.3 |
| 3.4 Source of truth is explicit | contract §2.4 |
| 3.5 ACs are testable | proof §3.1, §3.2 |
| 3.6 Negative space mandatory for gates | proof §2.3, §3.3 |
| 3.7 Non-goals mandatory for substantial issues | contract §2.5 |
| 3.8 Exceptions are debt | constraints §2.2, §3.3 |
| 3.9 Examples must obey issue's own rules | labels §Discipline |
| 3.10 Path bases must be named | constraints §2.3, §3.4 |
| 3.11 Cross-surface projections must be checked | constraints §2.4, §3.5 |
| 3.12 No future-as-present | contract §2.3 (status truth) |
| 3.13 Issue owns entry point, not full depth | root §Core Principle |
| 3.14 Contradiction resolution must be explicit | contract §3.5 |

All 14 rules are represented in the subskill family. Some rules are implicit in examples and ❌/✅ pairs rather than numbered rules — this is intentional: the skill/SKILL.md generation constraint (Tier 3) says rules should be imperative and support the coherence formula; the distribution does this.

---

## §Debt

1. **`issue/labels` artifact_class is `reference`, not `skill`.** The `cnos.core/skills/skill/SKILL.md` reference class is defined as "mainly lookup-oriented." The label taxonomy is a lookup table, so `reference` is the correct classification. However, reference classes have `kata_surface: none` which means the labels taxonomy has no kata practice surface. If γ decides a kata would add value for label selection, a separate subskill could be created. This is intentional and the issue does not require a kata for labels.

2. **`issue/contract` kata is embedded but brief.** The embedded kata scenario covers one context (CUE schema CI gate). Future cycles could extend it with more scenarios (e.g., skill refactor contracts, runtime behavior contracts). Not a gap for this issue's scope.

3. **No `parent` field in `issue/labels` triggers a CTB v0.1 lint warning if such a linter exists.** The `parent` field is listed in CTB LANGUAGE-SPEC.md as a composition field (`calls`, `calls_dynamic`, etc.) but not in the required or invocation fields of §2.1–§2.2. It is present in all new subskills (`parent: issue`) as an optional field. Not a hard-gate gap.

4. **`issue/contract` §2.13 `Handoff checklist` was not extracted into the subskill.** The handoff checklist lives in the root skill. The root skill's checklist is a compressed form. The original §2.13 had a longer checklist (17 items). The root skill now has 15 items. Two items from the original were consolidated:
   - "Examples obey the rules they are demonstrating" — preserved.
   - "CI additions include notification/status implications" — preserved.
   - "No draft/target behavior is described as shipped" → consolidated with "Status truth is explicit."
   This is a cosmetic compression, not a semantic loss. The constraint is captured in `issue/contract/SKILL.md §3.2`.
