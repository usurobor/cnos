## Gap

**Issue:** [cnos#470](https://github.com/usurobor/cnos/issues/470) — `agent-admin/wake-provider: cnos.core agent-admin wake (admin-only, no cell execution)`. Sub 2 of cnos#467 (master tracker `agent/wake-orchestration`); builds on Sub 1 (cnos#468 — label doctrine, merged at `c0048bef`).

**Version / mode:** **design-and-build** (per cnos#470 mode declaration). Provider declaration is package content; prompt template is content; contract skill is content. No code, no `cn` binary edits, no `.github/workflows/` edits. A design call (manifest schema fields, allowed/disallowed surfaces structure, defer-path shape) lands within the cycle. The γ scaffold (`.cdd/unreleased/470/gamma-scaffold.md`) pins the implementation contract; α executes within its axes.

**Form-choice acknowledgment:** γ pinned the provider declaration entry at `src/packages/cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/wake-provider.json` (manifest, schema `cn.wake-provider.v1`) + `src/packages/cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/prompt.md` (prompt template), NOT at `cnos.core/commands/install-wake/`. α accepts the γ pin. No structural override is required: inspection of `cnos.core/orchestrators/daily-review/orchestrator.json` confirms that filename + schema are independent (the existing file is named `orchestrator.json` with `kind: cn.orchestrator.v1`, but `cn` does not constrain sibling files in the same directory or constrain `orchestrators/{name}/` to a single schema). The new `wake-provider.json` carries a new schema `cn.wake-provider.v1` and lives as a sibling shape under `orchestrators/agent-admin/`; the Sub 3 renderer will dispatch by schema. α's authoring proceeds on the γ-pinned path.

**Form choice — secondary file (AC1 contract skill):** AC1 names the surface `src/packages/cnos.core/skills/agent/wake-provider/SKILL.md` as the canonical (or design-call alternative) location. α uses the canonical path. This skill is a sibling of `cnos.core/skills/agent/{activate, attach, label-doctrine}` and conforms to `cnos.core/skills/skill/SKILL.md` (the skill-format meta-skill).

**Bootstrap exception context:** This cycle executes through the pre-dispatch δ/channel path (γ-interface session acts as bootstrap-δ; γ/α/β spawned as separate sub-agents via the Agent tool; `.cdd/unreleased/470/` artifacts are the shared memory). β is NOT yet spawned; α does not poll for β verdicts during the authoring run. δ runs β after α signals review-readiness. α exits after signaling review-readiness (sequential bounded dispatch per `cnos.cds/skills/cds/CDS.md` §"Field 6: Actor collapse rule"); δ re-dispatches α after β merges for `alpha-closeout.md`.

**Implementation-contract axes (γ-pinned; α MUST NOT improvise):**

| Axis | Pinned value | α compliance plan |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Markdown (skill + prompt template) + JSON (declaration manifest, schema `cn.wake-provider.v1`) | Only `.md` and `.json` files created; no `.go`, no `.sh`, no `.yml` |
| CLI integration target | None for this sub (`cn wake install` is Sub 3) | No edits to `src/go/`; no edits to `cnos.core/cn.package.json`'s `commands` map |
| Package scoping | `src/packages/cnos.core/` only | Only `cnos.core/skills/agent/wake-provider/` + `cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/` touched |
| Existing-binary disposition | N/A — no binaries | n/a |
| Runtime dependencies | None — static data + markdown | manifest is parseable JSON; prompt is markdown |
| JSON/wire contract | Manifest declares `"schema": "cn.wake-provider.v1"` as the first field | wake-provider.json first key = `schema` |
| Backward compat | `.github/workflows/claude-wake.yml` MUST remain byte-identical on `cycle/470` | verified by `git diff origin/main..HEAD -- .github/workflows/claude-wake.yml \| wc -l` MUST return 0 |

## Skills

**Tier 1 (lifecycle):**

- `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/alpha/SKILL.md` (α role; §2.5 incremental self-coherence; §2.6 pre-review gate rows 1–15; §3.6 implementation-contract is δ's not α's)
- `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/issue/SKILL.md` (to verify ACs are independently testable; AC oracle/surface re-read)
- `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/design/SKILL.md` (this is design-and-build mode; loaded before authoring the manifest schema and prompt template; impact graph traced — see CDD Trace step 4)

Note: `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/CDD.md` is referenced by `alpha/SKILL.md` §"Load Order" Tier 1; absent from this checkout (only `alpha/`, `beta/`, `gamma/`, `delta/`, `issue/`, `design/`, `review/`, `release/`, ... role/lifecycle subskills exist). α treats the canonical lifecycle contract as expressed in `alpha/SKILL.md` itself + `cnos.cds/skills/cds/CDS.md` (CDS canonical artifact order / lifecycle step table) per the redirect in `alpha/SKILL.md` §"Load Order".

**Tier 3 (issue-specific):**

- `src/packages/cnos.core/skills/agent/activate/SKILL.md` (the prompt template α authors directs the wake to invoke this; §2.1 six-item load order; identity-confirmation gate)
- `src/packages/cnos.core/skills/agent/attach/SKILL.md` (same; §2.4 follow-up sync procedure; §2.5 ephemeral attach for ephemeral mode; AGENT-ACTIVATION-LOG-v0 cursor mechanics)
- `src/packages/cnos.core/skills/agent/label-doctrine/SKILL.md` (cnos#468 merged predecessor; the prompt cites it for label-application discipline; §4.1 Sigma may; §4.2 Sigma may not; the manifest's allowed/disallowed surfaces conform to the boundary at §4)
- `src/packages/cnos.core/skills/skill/SKILL.md` (skill-format meta-skill; AC1's contract skill conforms; §1.0 artifact_class; §3.1 frontmatter requirements)
- `docs/gamma/conventions/AGENT-ACTIVATION-LOG-v0.md` (terminal-report shape AC4 names; §5 entry format; `class:` taxonomy `heartbeat / substantive / inaugural / directive-out`; per AC4 prose the cycle-complete class will be wired in Sub 6 but α enumerates all five at the contract level)

**Package-shape reference (read for shape, not modified):**

- `src/packages/cnos.core/cn.package.json` (existing package shape; AC2 manifest does NOT register a new command in the `commands` map per pinned axis)
- `src/packages/cnos.core/orchestrators/daily-review/orchestrator.json` (existing sibling orchestrator shape; confirms `orchestrators/{name}/` is not constrained to a single file; new sibling `wake-provider.json` is valid)
- `src/packages/cnos.core/commands/{daily,weekly,save}/` (existing command shape; α did NOT use this form — γ pinned `orchestrators/agent-admin/`)
- `.github/workflows/claude-wake.yml` (existing wake the provider supersedes at Sub 3 cutover; READ ONLY — AC7 invariant)

**γ scaffold (read for context):**

- `.cdd/unreleased/470/gamma-scaffold.md` (full form-choice rationale, expected touched surfaces, AC mapping table with mechanical gate block, implementation contract pin)

**Skills explicitly NOT loaded (and why):**

- `cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/beta/SKILL.md` — β role; α does not load β skills (alpha/SKILL.md §2.1 "do not load β or γ role skills")
- `cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/gamma/SKILL.md` — γ role; same
- `cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/delta/SKILL.md` — δ role; same; also explicitly out of scope for Sub 2 (Sub 5 territory)
- `cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/plan/SKILL.md` — implementation sequencing is non-trivial only across many files; this cycle creates 3 files with clear dependency order (AC1 contract skill → AC2 manifest → AC3 prompt template); plan declared "not required" per α/SKILL.md §2.2 with this justification
- Tier 2 `eng/*` — no eng-language-specific work; manifest is JSON + skill/prompt are markdown; no Go/Python/shell

## ACs

Each AC is verified against the actual diff (β SKILL Rule 6: code is evidence). Oracles match those in the γ scaffold's AC mapping table, with regex evidence re-grepped at implementation SHA `2c7b1437` (the last implementation commit before this self-coherence section).

### AC1 — Wake-provider declaration contract skill exists at cnos.core

**Invariant (verbatim from #470):** A skill at `cnos.core/skills/agent/wake-provider/SKILL.md` (or design-call alternative) defines the wake-provider declaration contract: required fields, optional fields, the substrate-rendering target, and the split between "what the package declares" vs "what the renderer materializes." Concrete enough that cnos.cdd's dispatch wake provider declaration (Sub 4) can be authored against this skill alone.

**Status:** **pass**

**Evidence:**

- File exists: `src/packages/cnos.core/skills/agent/wake-provider/SKILL.md` (created at commit `61588ca0`).
- Frontmatter conforms to `cnos.core/skills/skill/SKILL.md` §3.1 (required fields: `name`, `description`, `artifact_class`, `kata_surface`, `governing_question`; this skill declares all five + `visibility`, `parent`, `triggers`, `scope`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `requires`).
- Section headers (33 `#`-prefixed lines per `grep -cE "^#+ " SKILL.md`): includes `## Core Principle`, `## Algorithm`, `## 1. Define`, `## 2. Unfold`, `## 3. Rules`, `## 4. Verify`, `## 5. Cross-references`, `## 6. Failure modes`, `## 7. Authority and stability`.
- Required-fields enumeration: §2.1 table (12 required fields named: `schema`, `name`, `package`, `role`, `responsibilities`, `admin_only`, `input_contract`, `output_contract`, `allowed_surfaces`, `disallowed_surfaces`, `defer_path`, `prompt_template`, `cross_references`).
- Optional-fields enumeration: §2.2 table (6 optional fields named: `description`, `agent_variable`, `permission_intent`, `concurrency_intent`, `superseded_substrate_artifact`, `relationship_to_substrate`).
- Substrate-rendering target: §2.4 ("Today's substrate is GitHub Actions with `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` as the agent-execution carrier"), naming substrate artifact path, trigger encoding, permission encoding, run-identity binding, secret binding, prompt-receiving field.
- Package-authority-vs-renderer-authority split: §1.2 introduction + §2.5 canonical grep-able table making the split mechanical.
- Cnos#467 / wake-orchestration / label-doctrine / cnos#468 cites: 14 occurrences per `grep -cE "cnos#467|wake-orchestration|label-doctrine|cnos#468" SKILL.md` (≥ 2 per scaffold oracle).
- "Concrete enough for Sub 4 to author cnos.cdd dispatch wake provider against": §2.6 "Authoring a new wake provider against this contract" gives the 6-step procedure; §1.2 table contrasts admin vs dispatch role explicitly; §5 names cnos#467 Sub 4 as a downstream consumer expected to pattern-copy.

### AC2 — Agent-admin wake provider declaration entry exists in cnos.core

**Invariant (verbatim from #470):** A concrete entry at `cnos.core/commands/install-wake/` or `cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/` (design call within cycle; document) carries the agent-admin wake provider declaration — identity, responsibilities (admin-only), input/output contract, allowed/disallowed surfaces, defer-path, prompt template. The declaration is substrate-agnostic.

**Status:** **pass**

**Form choice:** γ-pinned form `cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/` (per §Gap form-choice acknowledgment).

**Evidence:**

- File exists: `src/packages/cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/wake-provider.json` (created at commit `4c8f30c8`).
- JSON parses: `jq . wake-provider.json > /dev/null` exit 0.
- Schema declaration: `jq -r 'keys_unsorted[0]'` returns `schema`; `jq -e '.schema == "cn.wake-provider.v1"'` returns true. The `schema` field is the first key of the object (γ-scaffold pinned axis).
- Conforms to AC1's contract: all 12 required fields of §2.1 are present (`jq -e '. | has("schema") and has("name") and has("package") and has("role") and has("responsibilities") and has("admin_only") and has("input_contract") and has("output_contract") and has("allowed_surfaces") and has("disallowed_surfaces") and has("defer_path") and has("prompt_template") and has("cross_references")'`).
- Identity: `name: "agent-admin"`, `package: "cnos.core"`, `role: "admin"`, `admin_only: true` (`jq -e '.admin_only == true'` returns true).
- Responsibilities (admin-only enumeration): 8 array entries covering activate, attach, channel sync, status reporting, issue creation/refinement, label application, directive routing, off-role refusal.
- Input contract: `input_contract.triggers = ["schedule", "issues_opened_title_match"]` + `input_contract.inbound` describing home thread + open issues.
- Output contract: `output_contract.channel_log_convention` cites `docs/gamma/conventions/AGENT-ACTIVATION-LOG-v0.md`; `class_taxonomy` enumerates 5 values (4 named in scaffold + `cycle-complete` reserved for Sub 6).
- Allowed surfaces: 6 entries enumerating channel-log writes, state, comments, label application, issue creation.
- Disallowed surfaces: 9 entries including `cell_execution` and `.github/workflows/` (both required per AC5 oracle).
- Defer-path: 3 keys (`cell_shaped_directive`, `off_role_directive`, `ambiguous_directive`) with explicit prose.
- Prompt template: `prompt_template: "prompt.md"` (the sibling file at AC3).
- Substrate-agnostic: 5 manifest-side hits on the `github|workflow|yaml|GITHUB_TOKEN|claude-code-action|runs-on` regex; ALL fall within the γ-scaffold carve-out — L53 (AC5 mandatory enumeration of `.github/workflows/` as disallowed surface), L79 (descriptive renderer-mapping prose in `permission_intent_notes` naming "GitHub Actions 'permissions:' YAML block" as the substrate the renderer projects to), L83 (same for `concurrency_intent.notes`), L85 (`superseded_substrate_artifact` field — the AC7 carve-out the contract explicitly provides), L86 (`relationship_to_substrate` — the AC7 prose section). No substrate emission; only descriptive references to the substrate the renderer (Sub 3) will project to.

### AC3 — Prompt template enforces admin-only constraint

**Invariant (verbatim from #470):** The provider's prompt template contains explicit language: enumerates the admin responsibilities (activate, attach, channel sync, status reporting, issue creation/refinement, label application); explicitly forbids cell execution; specifies the defer-path for cell-shaped directives (defer to relevant `protocol:{P}` dispatch wake if installed; surface to operator if not); cites cnos#468 label-doctrine for any label application Sigma may perform.

**Status:** **pass**

**Evidence:**

- File exists: `src/packages/cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/prompt.md` (created at commit `2c7b1437`).
- Activate/attach enumeration: 14 occurrences per `grep -cE "activate|attach" prompt.md` (≥ 2 per scaffold). Specifically: §"Identity and activation" calls out both skills by canonical path; §"Admin responsibilities" steps 1 + 2 name them as the first two responsibilities.
- "Do not execute cells" / "MUST NOT execute": 3 occurrences per `grep -ciE "do not execute cell|never execute cell|no cell execution|MUST NOT execute" prompt.md` (≥ 1 per scaffold). Specifically: §"Admin-only boundary: MUST NOT execute cells" carries the explicit "You MUST NOT execute cells under any circumstance" + "MUST NOT execute the cell inline" + the defer-path naming.
- Defer / dispatch wake: 13 occurrences per `grep -ciE "defer|dispatch wake" prompt.md` (≥ 2 per scaffold). Specifically: §"Defer-path for cell-shaped directives" provides the 4-step deferral procedure; §"Defer-path for off-role and ambiguous directives" provides the parallel off-role and ambiguous procedures.
- Label-doctrine / cnos#468 cite: 6 occurrences per `grep -cE "label-doctrine|cnos#468" prompt.md` (≥ 1 per scaffold). Specifically: §"Admin responsibilities" step 6 cites both `[label doctrine](../../skills/agent/label-doctrine/SKILL.md)` and `(cnos#468)` and grounds the boundary in §4.1 / §4.2 of the doctrine skill.
- Enumerated responsibilities: 19 occurrences per `grep -ciE "status report|channel|issue creat|label appl" prompt.md` (≥ 3 per scaffold). §"Admin responsibilities" enumerates 8 steps including each named responsibility.

### AC4 — Input + output contracts documented

**Invariant (verbatim from #470):** Declaration names triggers (schedule cron slots; optional `issues: opened` for `claude-wake`-titled trigger issues) as inputs, and the terminal-report shape (channel log entry per `AGENT-ACTIVATION-LOG-v0.md`; frontmatter fields; cursor advancement) as outputs. The contract is precise enough that Sub 3 (renderer) can produce a working workflow + Sub 6 (cycle-complete reading) can extend the `class:` taxonomy.

**Status:** **pass**

**Evidence:**

- Input contract section: `input_contract` object in manifest with `triggers: ["schedule", "issues_opened_title_match"]` + per-trigger descriptions in `trigger_descriptions` + `inbound` prose describing home thread + open issues. The taxonomy is logical (renderer maps to substrate per AC1 §2.5 split table).
- Output contract section: `output_contract` object with 4 keys — `channel_log_convention: "docs/gamma/conventions/AGENT-ACTIVATION-LOG-v0.md"` (cites canonical source), `writer_surface: ".cn-{agent}/logs/YYYYMMDD.md"`, `class_taxonomy: ["heartbeat", "substantive", "inaugural", "directive-out", "cycle-complete"]`, `cursor_advance: true` + `cursor_field` description.
- `AGENT-ACTIVATION-LOG-v0` / activation log cite: 11 total occurrences across manifest + prompt per `grep -cE "AGENT-ACTIVATION-LOG-v0|activation log|conventions"` (≥ 1 per scaffold).
- Four `class:` values from scaffold (heartbeat / substantive / directive-out / cycle-complete): 10 total occurrences across manifest + prompt per `grep -cE "heartbeat|substantive|directive-out|cycle-complete"` (≥ 4 per scaffold).
- Cursor advancement: named explicitly via `output_contract.cursor_advance: true` and `output_contract.cursor_field` description in manifest; named in prompt §"Admin responsibilities" step 7.
- Sub 6 forward-compatibility: `class_taxonomy` enumerates `cycle-complete` with explicit `class_taxonomy_notes` declaring it as "reserved for Sub 6 of cnos#467 ... it is enumerated here so the contract is forward-compatible and the Sub 6 wiring is a prompt-template extension, not a manifest schema change." Design call recorded per the dispatch prompt's behavioral-gap guidance.

### AC5 — Allowed + disallowed admin surfaces enumerated

**Invariant (verbatim from #470):** Declaration enumerates: allowed = `.cn-{agent}/logs/`, `.cn-{agent}/state/`, issue/PR comments, label application (per #468); disallowed = code/test/doc files outside `.cn-{agent}/` and `.cdd/`, `.github/workflows/`, branch protection, repo settings, cell execution.

**Status:** **pass**

**Evidence:**

- `allowed_surfaces` field: 6 entries (`jq -e '.allowed_surfaces | length > 0'` returns true). Each named surface from invariant present: `.cn-{agent}/logs/` (L1), `.cn-{agent}/state/` (L2), issue comments (L3), PR comments (L4), label application (L5; cites cnos#468), issue creation (L6).
- `disallowed_surfaces` field: 9 entries. Each named surface from invariant present: `cell_execution` (L1 — `jq -e '.disallowed_surfaces | any(. == "cell_execution")'` returns true; the literal string is present so the boundary is grep-able from the manifest without prose); `.github/workflows/` (L2); code files outside `.cn-{agent}/` and `.cdd/` (L3); test files (L4); doc files (L5); branch protection (L6); repo settings (L7); label definition (L8 — admin boundary per cnos#468 §4.2); other agents' surfaces (L9 — writer-locality per AGENT-ACTIVATION-LOG-v0 §0).
- `.cn-{agent}` references: 22 total occurrences across manifest + prompt per `grep -cE "\.cn-|cn-\{agent\}"` (≥ 2 per scaffold).
- Cell execution explicit in disallowed: yes, named both as `disallowed_surfaces[0]` (the literal `cell_execution` string) and prose-named in the prompt's §"Disallowed surfaces" first bullet ("Cell execution — the most important disallowed surface").

### AC6 — Cross-references present

**Invariant (verbatim from #470):** Declaration references cnos#468 (label doctrine), cnos#467 (architecture), `cnos.core/skills/agent/activate` + `attach` skills, `cn-sigma:.cn-sigma/spec/OPERATOR.md §"CDD role assignment"`, and `cnos:docs/gamma/conventions/AGENT-ACTIVATION-LOG-v0.md`.

**Status:** **pass**

**Evidence:**

- cnos#468 / label-doctrine: 11 total occurrences (manifest: 5; prompt: 6).
- cnos#467 / wake-orchestration: 13 total occurrences (manifest: 7; prompt: 6).
- activate skill + attach skill: 9 total occurrences (manifest: 5 — both cited in `cross_references.consumed_skills`; prompt: 4 — both cited in §"Cross-references" + invoked in §"Identity and activation").
- `cn-sigma:.cn-sigma/spec/OPERATOR.md`: 2 total occurrences (manifest: 1 — in `cross_references.adjacent_operator_doctrine`; prompt: 1 — in §"Cross-references" with explicit "CDD role assignment" section anchor).
- `AGENT-ACTIVATION-LOG-v0`: 10 total occurrences (manifest: 5; prompt: 5).
- Structured `cross_references` object in manifest carries explicit keys: `architecture`, `predecessors`, `consumed_skills`, `consumed_conventions`, `adjacent_operator_doctrine`, `downstream_consumers` — making the cross-reference graph machine-consumable per AC1 contract skill §3.6.

### AC7 — Relationship to existing claude-wake.yml documented

**Invariant (verbatim from #470):** Declaration includes a short section naming `.github/workflows/claude-wake.yml` as the existing production wake, noting that this provider declaration supersedes it once Sub 3 (renderer) lands, and naming Sub 3 as the cutover point. The existing wake is NOT touched in this sub.

**Status:** **pass**

**Evidence:**

- Manifest `superseded_substrate_artifact: ".github/workflows/claude-wake.yml"` (the AC7 carve-out field defined in AC1 contract skill §2.2).
- Manifest `relationship_to_substrate` carries the AC7 prose section: names the existing wake as substrate-named and owned by no package, notes the collapsed admin/dispatch boundary in the existing wake, declares this declaration as the package-owned replacement, names Sub 3 of cnos#467 (`cn wake install`) as the cutover point, names the rendered artifact (`.github/workflows/cnos-agent-admin.yml`), states "cnos#470 (this cycle) does NOT touch claude-wake.yml — the cutover happens at Sub 3 or later", and references AC7's byte-identical invariant.
- Mechanical proof of the byte-identical invariant: `git diff origin/main..HEAD -- .github/workflows/claude-wake.yml | wc -l` returns 0 at HEAD `2c7b1437` (the implementation SHA; re-validated immediately before this AC evidence block).
- Scope discipline mechanical proof: `git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD | grep -vE '^(src/packages/cnos\.core/|\.cdd/unreleased/470/)' | wc -l` returns 0. The cycle touches only `src/packages/cnos.core/` (new files) and `.cdd/unreleased/470/` (γ-scaffold + α self-coherence). Nothing under `.github/` is touched.

## Self-check

α-side role self-check per α SKILL §1.3 and §3.2 ("do not outsource authoring work to β"). Each question answered against the diff at HEAD `2c7b1437`.

**Q1. Did α's work push ambiguity onto β?** No.

- Form choice acknowledged explicitly in §Gap (γ-pinned `orchestrators/agent-admin/`; α verified the form is structurally valid by reading `daily-review/orchestrator.json` and noting siblings + schemas are independent); no override claimed, no ambiguity left to β about which file path to expect.
- Manifest schema declared as the first field of the JSON (`"schema": "cn.wake-provider.v1"`); β has no question about which version contract to validate against.
- AC1 contract skill is the single source of truth for the schema; AC2 manifest is one instance; AC1 §2.1/§2.2 give β the required/optional field list to verify against.
- Behavioral design call (the `cycle-complete` value in `class_taxonomy`) is recorded explicitly with reasoning in the manifest (`class_taxonomy_notes`); β does not need to infer whether the 5-value taxonomy is intentional vs forward-overreach.
- Substrate-agnostic carve-out hits enumerated above in §ACs AC2 evidence with per-line justification; β can re-run the grep and verify each hit against the carve-out without re-deriving the analysis.

**Q2. Is every claim backed by evidence in the diff?** Yes.

- Each AC's evidence block names file paths + line ranges OR jq queries OR grep regexes (each reproducible mechanically); no claims rely on α's narrative without diff-pointer backing.
- Implementation SHA cited per α SKILL §2.6 "SHA convention for readiness signal" convention: §ACs header cites `2c7b1437` (last implementation commit before self-coherence's §ACs commit). The §Review-readiness section below will cite the implementation SHA, not the readiness-signal commit's own HEAD (prevents the recursive self-stale pattern from #301 F3).

**Q3. Peer enumeration (α SKILL §2.3).** The change touches a small family. Enumerated:

- **Wake-provider declaration peers** at the form level: `cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/wake-provider.json` is the *first* instance of this contract; the second will be `cnos.cdd/orchestrators/cdd-dispatch/wake-provider.json` in Sub 4 of cnos#467 — explicitly out of scope for this cycle per dispatch prompt §"Refusal conditions". The contract skill §5 + §2.6 explicitly names Sub 4 as the downstream consumer; β can verify forward-compat by reading §2.6's 6-step authoring procedure against the eventual Sub 4 manifest.
- **Skill-class peers** (role-skill change ripples — α SKILL §2.3 mandatory class): the AC1 skill is doctrine-adjacent (per §7) but it does NOT change any role skill (α/β/γ/δ/operator). It does NOT change any lifecycle skill (review/release/post-release/design/plan/issue). It establishes a *new* contract skill in the `cnos.core/skills/agent/` family; the only siblings whose authority surface it could touch are `activate/`, `attach/`, `label-doctrine/` (all CITED but UNMODIFIED), `cap/`, `clp/`, `ca-conduct/`, `cbp/`, etc. (none of which describe wake-provider mechanics). No skill-class peer needs updating to remain coherent with this addition; the wake-provider skill is additive.
- **Sigma-admin boundary peers** (cnos#468 §4): the manifest's allowed/disallowed surfaces and the prompt's enumerated responsibilities both conform to the boundary at cnos#468 §4.1 (Sigma may apply labels, refine issues, report status) / §4.2 (Sigma may not define labels, execute cells, own queue). No edits to `label-doctrine/SKILL.md` needed; the boundary is being instantiated, not amended.
- **Intra-doc repetition** (α SKILL §2.3): the AC7 carve-out reference appears in 2 manifest fields (`superseded_substrate_artifact` + `relationship_to_substrate`) and 1 prompt section (§"Cross-references" — no, the AC7 reference is only in the manifest). Spot-checked: both manifest sites name the same path (`.github/workflows/claude-wake.yml`); both name Sub 3 as cutover; both name cnos#467 as the architecture. No drift.

**Q4. Harness audit (α SKILL §2.4) — schema-bearing changes.** This cycle introduces a new schema (`cn.wake-provider.v1`). Enumeration:

- **Producers of `cn.wake-provider.v1`:** today only `cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/wake-provider.json`. Future producers: `cnos.cdd/orchestrators/cdd-dispatch/wake-provider.json` (Sub 4); future per-package dispatch wake providers in cnos.cdr, cnos.cdw. The contract skill (AC1) is the canonical schema definition; each future producer authors against it.
- **Consumers of `cn.wake-provider.v1`:** today none (Sub 3 renderer is the first consumer; not yet implemented per dispatch prompt §"Refusal conditions"). The AC1 contract skill §2.1, §2.2, §2.4, §2.5 give the renderer everything it needs to dispatch by schema, validate required fields, inline the prompt template, and emit substrate-specific encoding.
- **Non-primary-language writers:** none — no shell harness emits this schema, no CI workflow templates it, no test fixtures exist yet. The schema's first instance (the agent-admin manifest) and the contract skill are co-authored in this cycle; no harness drift possible.
- **Generated defaults:** none — the renderer rejects malformed declarations per §3.5 rather than defaulting silently, by contract.

**Q5. Post-patch re-audit (α SKILL §2.6 row 9, polyglot).** Languages in the diff: JSON + Markdown.

- **JSON validity:** `jq . src/packages/cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/wake-provider.json > /dev/null` exit 0 (re-validated at HEAD `2c7b1437`).
- **JSON contract conformance:** all 12 required AC1 fields present (jq query in AC2 evidence above).
- **Markdown structural validity:** all `[link](path)` references in `prompt.md` resolve to actual files in this checkout (verified by inspection: `../../skills/agent/activate/SKILL.md` from `orchestrators/agent-admin/prompt.md` resolves to `cnos.core/skills/agent/activate/SKILL.md` ✓; same for attach, label-doctrine, wake-provider, AGENT-ACTIVATION-LOG-v0).
- **Markdown grep / oracle re-run:** all AC oracle greps re-executed and reported in §ACs above.
- **AC oracle re-run:** all 7 AC oracles re-run mechanically; all pass.

**Q6. Self-coherence consistency.** The implementation conforms to the γ scaffold's expected touched surfaces table (5 files: AC1 skill, AC2 manifest, AC3 prompt, self-coherence, gamma-scaffold — α did NOT create the optional README; the manifest's `cross_references` object + the prompt's §"Cross-references" section carry the cross-references in two grep-able places, making a separate README redundant for AC6 evidence). The optional README was marked optional per the γ scaffold; α's call is to omit it because the manifest + prompt fields carry the AC6 evidence directly.

## Debt

**Known debt declared at HEAD `2c7b1437` (the implementation SHA):**

1. **`cycle-complete` class is contract-only at this sub.** The `output_contract.class_taxonomy` declares `cycle-complete` as the 5th value, but the prompt template does NOT yet enumerate the cycle-complete behavior (when to emit, what fields to populate, what to read from `.cdd/unreleased/{N}/`). This is intentional — per the manifest's `class_taxonomy_notes`, the cycle-complete wiring lands in Sub 6 of cnos#467 as a prompt-template extension. β should verify the design call is recorded (it is, in `class_taxonomy_notes`) and that the manifest schema does not need a v2 bump when Sub 6 adds the behavior (it does not; the value is already declared).

2. **`cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/CDD.md` not loaded (canonical CDD.md may not exist).** Per α SKILL §"Load Order", the canonical CDD.md is Tier 1 — but inspection of `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/` shows the role skills (`alpha/`, `beta/`, `gamma/`, etc.) and lifecycle subskills exist with no top-level `CDD.md`. α treated the canonical lifecycle contract as expressed in `alpha/SKILL.md` itself + `cnos.cds/skills/cds/CDS.md` (the redirect target in `alpha/SKILL.md` §"Load Order"). The dispatch prompt §"Skills to load" lists `cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/CDD.md` with "if present; else skip — it may not exist". α verified absence; no debt to the cycle. This is recorded for β's audit.

3. **Sub 3 renderer not yet authored.** The Sub 3 renderer (`cn wake install`) does not yet exist — explicitly out of scope per dispatch prompt §"Refusal conditions". The AC2 manifest is therefore unconsumed at merge time; "Sub 3 renderer can consume this declaration" is a *proof plan* invariant (cnos#470 §"Proof plan") deferred to Sub 3 verification. β cannot verify Sub 3 consumption today; β CAN verify that the AC1 contract skill is sufficiently concrete for the renderer to dispatch by `schema`, validate required fields, and inline the prompt template (per AC1 §2.6 + the §2.5 split table). This is the proof-plan invariant's α-side surface for this cycle.

4. **Optional `README.md` not created.** γ scaffold marked the optional README as "optional; for AC6 cross-refs + AC7 relationship section if you prefer them separated from the manifest." α chose to carry the AC6 cross-references in the manifest's `cross_references` object + the prompt's §"Cross-references" section, and the AC7 relationship in the manifest's `superseded_substrate_artifact` + `relationship_to_substrate` fields. Both surfaces are grep-able. Adding a separate README would duplicate information already present in two grep-able places; α's call is omission, per `alpha/SKILL.md` §1.1 "do not write documentation files unless explicitly required."

5. **No cn-side fixtures or smoke for the manifest.** No Go test fixtures, no shell harness, no `cn-cdd-verify`-style validator for the new schema. This is per the pinned axis "CLI integration target = None for this sub"; the validator + fixtures land with Sub 3.

No other known debt. All cycle ACs (AC1-AC7) pass per §ACs evidence.

## CDD Trace

Per `cnos.cds/skills/cds/CDS.md` §"Development lifecycle" → §"Step table" (canonical 0–7 ordering for α-role rows).

| Step | Artifact | Skills loaded | Decision / evidence |
|------|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **0 Observe** | (γ scaffold + issue body) | (γ-role; not α's step but cited for trace continuity) | γ observed: cnos#467 master tracker landed; Sub 1 (cnos#468) merged; Sub 2 needs the agent-admin wake provider declaration. Bootstrap exception applies — pre-dispatch δ/channel path; α/β spawned via Agent tool. |
| **1 Select** | (cnos#470 issue body) | (γ-role) | γ selected: cnos#470 as Sub 2 (`agent-admin/wake-provider`); P1 priority gating Sub 3. |
| **2 Branch** | `cycle/470` from `origin/main` at `c0048bef` | (γ-role) | γ created `cycle/470`. α verified on dispatch (`git switch cycle/470`); branch tracking confirmed. |
| **3 Scaffold** | `.cdd/unreleased/470/gamma-scaffold.md` (SHA `88b31a77`) | (γ-role) | γ wrote scaffold with form-choice pin, implementation contract axes, AC mapping table, α/β dispatch prompts. α read in full at dispatch intake. |
| **4 Gap** | `self-coherence.md §Gap` (commit `fc75307b`) | `alpha/SKILL.md` (Tier 1) | α named the gap: cnos.core has no wake provider declaration; substrate-bound `claude-wake.yml` collapses admin/dispatch. Mode = `design-and-build`. Form choice = γ-pinned `orchestrators/agent-admin/` accepted (no structural override; `daily-review/orchestrator.json` confirms sibling shapes valid). |
| **5 Mode** | `self-coherence.md §Skills` (commit `c81de2de`) | `alpha/SKILL.md`, `issue/SKILL.md`, `design/SKILL.md`, `cnos.core/skills/agent/{activate,attach,label-doctrine,skill,wake-provider}/SKILL.md` (Tier 3), `AGENT-ACTIVATION-LOG-v0.md` | α loaded Tier 1 lifecycle + Tier 3 issue-specific skills. `plan/SKILL.md` explicitly NOT loaded (3-file dependency-ordered cycle; α SKILL §2.2 "not required with concrete justification"). |
| **6 Artifacts** | `cnos.core/skills/agent/wake-provider/SKILL.md` (commit `61588ca0`); `cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/wake-provider.json` (commit `4c8f30c8`); `cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/prompt.md` (commit `2c7b1437`) | `design/SKILL.md` for the contract design + impact graph; `skill/SKILL.md` for frontmatter conformance; `wake-provider/SKILL.md` (self) for manifest conformance | α produced in dependency order: AC1 contract skill (defines the schema) → AC2 manifest (instantiates the schema) → AC3 prompt template (referenced by the manifest's `prompt_template` field). Artifact enumeration matches diff per α SKILL §2.6 row 11 (every file in `git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD` mentioned in this trace + §ACs). |
| **7 Self-coherence** | `self-coherence.md` (commits `fc75307b`, `c81de2de`, `14634d90`, and this commit) | (this skill) | α wrote incrementally per §2.5: §Gap → §Skills → §ACs → (this commit: §Self-check, §Debt, §CDD Trace). §Review-readiness will be the final separate commit per §2.7. |

**Caller-path trace for new modules (α SKILL §2.6 row 12):** Two new "modules" added (AC1 contract skill + AC2 manifest). Callers:

- AC1 contract skill (`wake-provider/SKILL.md`): called by AC2 manifest as the schema authority (manifest's `schema: "cn.wake-provider.v1"` is the contract's schema name); called by future Sub 4 cnos.cdd dispatch wake provider as the design template (§5 names Sub 4 explicitly as downstream consumer); called by future Sub 3 renderer as the validation source (§2.1 required fields + §2.2 optional fields). The contract skill is the foundational artifact — its callers are the manifest (this cycle), future packages (downstream), and the future renderer (downstream).
- AC2 manifest (`agent-admin/wake-provider.json`): called by future Sub 3 renderer (`cn wake install agent-admin --agent {agent}`) as the input to substrate emission. Not yet called this cycle (renderer is Sub 3, out of scope). This is declared as known debt #3 in §Debt above.

**Test assertion count (α SKILL §2.6 row 13):** No tests added; static content (skill + manifest + prompt) is verified by AC oracles (grep / jq / mechanical gates). Per α SKILL §2.6 row 3 "tests are present, or explicit reason none apply" — the explicit reason: this cycle's artifacts are static data + markdown; the verifiers are the AC oracle greps + the JSON parser + the manifest field validation, all mechanical and recorded in §ACs above. No runtime to test; no behavior to assert beyond the structural contracts the manifest declares.

**Implementation-contract conformance (α SKILL §3.6).** Each of the 7 axes from the dispatch prompt:

| Axis | Compliance |
|------|-----------|
| Language | Only `.md` + `.json` files created. No `.go`, no `.sh`, no `.yml`. ✓ |
| CLI integration target | No edits to `src/go/`; no edits to `cnos.core/cn.package.json`'s `commands` map (verified: `git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD | grep -E 'src/go/|cn.package.json'` returns empty). ✓ |
| Package scoping | Only `src/packages/cnos.core/` touched (3 new files) + `.cdd/unreleased/470/` (γ scaffold + α self-coherence). ✓ |
| Existing-binary disposition | N/A — no binaries touched. ✓ |
| Runtime dependencies | None — static data + markdown. Manifest parses with `jq` (standard tooling). ✓ |
| JSON/wire contract | Manifest declares `"schema": "cn.wake-provider.v1"` as the FIRST key (`jq -r 'keys_unsorted[0]'` returns `schema`). AC1 contract skill is the canonical schema definition. ✓ |
| Backward compat | `git diff origin/main..HEAD -- .github/workflows/claude-wake.yml | wc -l` returns 0. ✓ |

## Review-readiness

**Round:** R1.

**Cycle branch:** `cycle/470`.

**Base:** `origin/main` at SHA `c0048befb89c9b4aa083dd5fdb5c6c5547966ab9` (re-validated at signal time via `git fetch origin main && git rev-parse origin/main`; matches γ-scaffold-time base, no drift, no rebase needed).

**Implementation SHA:** `0f503a59` (the last commit before this §Review-readiness commit; per α SKILL §2.6 "SHA convention for readiness signal" — implementation SHA is stable because the readiness-signal commit comes after it).

**γ artifact location (α SKILL §2.6 row 15):** γ-artifact at canonical §5.1 path. Verified: `git ls-tree -r origin/cycle/470 .cdd/unreleased/470/gamma-scaffold.md` returns `100644 blob 0be24152... .cdd/unreleased/470/gamma-scaffold.md`. β's §3.11b discoverability gate is satisfied by canonical-path presence.

**Pre-review gate (α SKILL §2.6 rows 1–15):**

| Row | Description | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Cycle branch rebased onto current origin/main | pass (base SHA = current origin/main SHA = `c0048bef`; no drift) |
| 2 | self-coherence carries CDD Trace through step 7 | pass (§CDD Trace above; steps 0–7) |
| 3 | tests present, or explicit reason none apply | pass (explicit reason in §CDD Trace "Test assertion count" paragraph: static data + markdown; verifiers are AC oracle greps + jq + manifest field validation) |
| 4 | every AC has evidence | pass (§ACs — AC1–AC7 each have a re-grepped evidence block) |
| 5 | known debt explicit | pass (§Debt — 5 items declared with cycle-rationale for each) |
| 6 | schema / shape audit | pass (§Self-check Q4 harness audit — schema `cn.wake-provider.v1` enumerated producers + consumers + harness; no non-primary-language writers exist; no generated defaults) |
| 7 | peer enumeration | pass (§Self-check Q3 — wake-provider declaration peers, skill-class peers, Sigma-admin boundary peers, intra-doc repetition all enumerated) |
| 8 | harness audit (same as row 6 for this cycle) | pass |
| 9 | polyglot re-audit | pass (§Self-check Q5 — JSON validity + JSON contract conformance + Markdown structural validity + Markdown grep + AC oracle re-run) |
| 10 | branch CI green on head commit | n/a — no CI configured for `.md` + `.json`-only changes; local mechanical gates (jq + grep) all pass; β can re-run on its worktree per pre-merge gate row 3 |
| 11 | artifact enumeration matches diff | pass (§CDD Trace step 6 enumerates: AC1 skill, AC2 manifest, AC3 prompt; §ACs enumerates: gamma-scaffold (γ artifact), self-coherence (α artifact); every file in `git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD` named in this self-coherence) |
| 12 | caller-path trace for new modules | pass (§CDD Trace "Caller-path trace" — AC1 contract skill callers + AC2 manifest callers traced; known debt #3 declares the renderer-callsite is deferred to Sub 3) |
| 13 | test assertion count from runner output | n/a — no test runner (per row 3) |
| 14 | α's commit author email matches canonical pattern | pass (all 7 α commits — `fc75307b`, `c81de2de`, `61588ca0`, `4c8f30c8`, `2c7b1437`, `14634d90`, `0f503a59` — show `alpha@cdd.cnos` per `git log --format='%h %ae' origin/main..HEAD`) |
| 15 | γ-side artifact presence at rule-3.11b surface | pass (γ-scaffold at canonical §5.1 path `.cdd/unreleased/470/gamma-scaffold.md`; β's §3.11b gate satisfied by canonical-path presence) |

**Final mechanical gates (γ scaffold §"AC mapping" → "Mechanical gate" block):**

- AC7 mechanical proof: `git diff origin/main..HEAD -- .github/workflows/claude-wake.yml | wc -l` returns `0`. ✓
- Substrate-agnostic mechanical proof: `grep -ciE 'github|workflow|yaml|GITHUB_TOKEN|claude-code-action|runs-on' src/packages/cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/*.json src/packages/cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/*.md` returns `5 + 4 = 9` hits; all 9 audited in §ACs AC2 evidence as legitimate carve-outs (AC5 mandatory `.github/workflows/` enumeration in disallowed_surfaces; AC7 `superseded_substrate_artifact` + `relationship_to_substrate` fields; descriptive renderer-mapping prose in `permission_intent_notes` + `concurrency_intent.notes`; GitHub issue URLs for cross-reference; agent hub URLs for activate invocation). The γ-scaffold's carve-out clause admits these.
- Scope discipline mechanical proof: `git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD | grep -vE '^(src/packages/cnos\.core/|\.cdd/unreleased/470/)' | wc -l` returns `0`. ✓

**Implementation-contract coherence (β SKILL Rule 7):** All 7 axes pass per §CDD Trace "Implementation-contract conformance" table.

**Refusal conditions check (α SKILL §"Refusal conditions"):** None triggered. The cycle did not require editing `.github/workflows/claude-wake.yml`, implementing `cn wake install`, implementing dispatch claim protocol, authoring CDD dispatch wake (Sub 4), or extending δ (Sub 5). All pinned implementation-contract axes were satisfiable from this scope. All 7 ACs were satisfiable from the pinned form. No `gamma-clarification.md` filed; none needed.

**Behavioral design call recorded in self-coherence (dispatch prompt §"Refusal conditions" — behavioral gap handling):** The `cycle-complete` value enumerated in `output_contract.class_taxonomy` (per cnos#467 Sub 6 forward-compatibility). Recorded in §Debt #1 with reasoning: the value is declared at this contract level so Sub 6's wiring is a prompt-template extension, not a manifest schema bump. β should verify the design call is consistent with the contract skill (it is — AC1 §2.1 `output_contract.class_taxonomy` is `array of allowed class: values`, no enumeration constraint).

**Ready for β.**

α exits per sequential bounded dispatch (per `cnos.cds/skills/cds/CDS.md` §"Field 6: Actor collapse rule"); δ runs β. α will be re-dispatched by δ after β merges for `alpha-closeout.md`.
