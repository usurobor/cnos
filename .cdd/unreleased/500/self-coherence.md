# Self-coherence — cnos#500 — cdd/review-return

## §R0 Design decisions

### Command shape

`cn cell return` and `cn cell resume` — registered as `cell-return` and `cell-resume` in the kernel registry using the existing noun-verb dispatch pattern (`dispatch.go` `ResolveCommand` §1 lookup). User-facing: `cn cell return --issue N --verdict V --review path`, `cn cell resume --issue N`.

Rationale: the `cn cell` namespace is explicitly pinned in the implementation contract; the noun-verb pattern is the canonical form in this codebase (`dispatch.go` `GroupMembers`/`PrintGroup`); `return` and `resume` are the most semantically precise verbs for the two operations (return = deliver verdict; resume = re-arm the existing cycle).

### HI contract placement

New file `src/packages/cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/hi-contract.md`. The existing `prompt.md` is the functional wake prompt for the agent-admin wake — it is runtime-loaded by the substrate and must not carry doctrinal contract prose that is not wake-specific. A separate `hi-contract.md` is the correct placement for the HI behavioral contract (which governs all HI sessions, not just the agent-admin wake).

### AC6 enforcement mechanism

Convention-only enforcement with β Rule 7 as the backstop. CI grep of HI authorship signatures in role-owned paths is not feasible: the HI commits do not carry a stable machine-distinguishable authorship signature (the HI may be dispatched under any git identity; the only stable signal is the artifact path + content, which requires semantic parsing). The convention is: prohibited surfaces are named in `hi-contract.md`; β's Rule 7 diff-vs-contract verification catches violations at review time. This is the same enforcement model as the implementation-contract axes. Named as known debt in §Debt.

### δ SKILL.md amendment structure

New `§9.10` subsection in `delta/SKILL.md` for the `resumed-from-changes` wake-invoked mode shape. Existing §9.1–§9.9 preserved intact. The §9.6 carve-out ("status:changes is EXTERNAL") is amended to read: `cn cell return` acts on behalf of the operator's stated verdict — the operator is still the authority; the command is the mechanical translator. This preserves the carve-out's intent while installing the mechanism.

### Cycle sizing judgment

Keep as one cell. Five-factor check:
1. One new Go package (`src/go/internal/cell/`) — bounded; no changes to existing packages
2. Three existing surfaces touched (delta SKILL.md, agent-admin, dispatch-protocol) — all additive amendments
3. Spans design + code + docs — explicitly the declared mode ("design + build")
4. Design pass required and completed above
5. Operator suggested split as optional ("start with the live worker; γ can make that call") — γ kept whole; all 7 ACs are tightly coupled (the HI contract, the schema, the CLI command, and the δ amendment are a single conceptual unit that splits poorly: AC2+AC6+AC7 require the same schema, AC3+AC4 require the same CLI command, AC5 requires understanding both)

---

## §Gap

**Issue:** cnos#500 — cdd/review-return: mechanically route operator iterate verdicts back into an existing cell

**Version/mode:** R0 / design + build

**The gap:** The live CDS dispatch wake handles a cell through `status:review` with no autonomous mechanism to re-engage from `status:review` when the operator's final read returns `iterate-narrowly`. Without this primitive, the HI absorbs operator-final-read corrections inline — crossing role boundaries. This was observed empirically in cycle/497: the HI edited α-owned `self-coherence.md`, rewrote γ-owned `gamma-closeout.md`, and inserted §R1 sections into β/α/γ artifacts, framing the absorption as "δ-direct R1." That absorption was declared a `degraded_recovery: human_interface_applied_operator_patch` in `.cdd/unreleased/497/gamma-closeout.md §5`.

**This cycle installs:**
1. A typed `cn.operator-review.v1` schema for HI to capture operator verdicts
2. `cn cell return --issue N --verdict V --review path` — mechanical `status:review → status:changes` transition
3. `cn cell resume --issue N` — re-arm the existing cycle (branch + artifact directory preserved; R[N+1] appended)
4. δ SKILL.md §9 amendment for the `resumed-from-changes` wake-invoked mode shape
5. HI behavioral contract — explicit prohibited surfaces + MUST NOT language
6. `degraded_recovery` declaration schema as first-class convention

---

## §Skills

**Tier 1 — CDD lifecycle:**
- `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/alpha/SKILL.md` (this role)
- `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/delta/SKILL.md` (amended §9; §9.6 carve-out; §9.10 new subsection)

**Tier 2 — always-applicable eng:**
- `src/packages/cnos.core/skills/write/SKILL.md` (governing question, one-file-one-job, front-load the point)

**Tier 3 — issue-specific:**
- `src/packages/cnos.handoff/skills/handoff/dispatch/SKILL.md` (implementation contract; 7-axis schema; four-surface mesh)

**Active constraints from loaded skills:**
- write/SKILL.md §3.2 — one file, one governing question (applied to hi-contract.md and operator-review/SKILL.md)
- write/SKILL.md §3.4 — front-load the point (applied to all authored Markdown)
- alpha/SKILL.md §2.5 — incremental self-coherence write discipline (one section per commit)
- alpha/SKILL.md §2.3 — peer enumeration before closure claims
- alpha/SKILL.md §3.6 — implementation contract is δ's; α MUST NOT improvise

---

## §ACs

Per-AC oracle run against branch HEAD `f7d88053` (implementation commit).

### AC1 — Typed operator-review schema

**Claim:** `cn.operator-review.v1` schema defined; HI can produce a valid conforming artifact.

**Evidence:**
- `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/operator-review/SKILL.md` exists (new file, created this cycle)
- Required fields enumerated: `schema`, `issue`, `pr`, `verdict` (enum: converge/iterate/reject/clarify), `reviewer`, `captured_by`, `captured_at`, `findings_count`
- Example artifact in §2 of SKILL.md demonstrates all required fields
- cycle/497's `operator-review.md` conforms: all 8 required fields present at lines 2–10 (verified by grep)
  - `schema: cn.operator-review.v1` ✓
  - `issue: 497` ✓
  - `pr: 499` ✓
  - `verdict: iterate` ✓
  - `reviewer: human-operator` ✓
  - `captured_by: gamma-interface (HI)` ✓
  - `captured_at: 2026-06-26 (UTC)` ✓
  - `findings_count: 6` ✓

**Pass:** all required fields present in schema definition; example conforms; 497 artifact conforms.

---

### AC2 — HI records verdict without editing role-owned matter

**Claim:** HI behavioral contract documented; "invisible meddling" cited; HI attribution distinguished; prohibited surfaces listed.

**Evidence:**
- `src/packages/cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/hi-contract.md` exists (new file, created this cycle)
- §2 lists prohibited surfaces explicitly (self-coherence.md, beta-review.md, alpha-closeout.md, beta-closeout.md, gamma-closeout.md, gamma-scaffold.md)
- §2 uses MUST NOT language (not "should avoid")
- `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/delta/SKILL.md` "invisible meddling" failure mode cited by path in §2 and §7
- §4 distinguishes HI attribution: `captured_by: gamma-interface (HI)` vs role identities; states HI MUST NOT sign with role identities

**Pass:** all four oracle conditions met (explicit MUST NOT; named prohibited surfaces; delta SKILL.md citation by path; attribution distinguished).

---

### AC3 — Mechanical `status:review` → `status:changes` transition

**Claim:** `cn cell return --verdict iterate` on a cell at `status:review` removes `status:review` and adds `status:changes`.

**Evidence:**
- `src/go/internal/cli/cmd_cell.go` — `CellReturnCmd` registered as `cell-return`; dispatches to `cell.Returner.Return()`
- `src/go/internal/cell/cell.go` — `Returner.Return()` on `iterate`/`reject` calls `applyLabelTransition()`:
  - removes `status:review`: `gh issue edit N --remove-label status:review`
  - adds `status:changes`: `gh issue edit N --add-label status:changes`
- On `converge`: no label transition applied (verified by `TestReturner_Return_Converge` — output does not contain "status:changes")
- `src/go/cmd/cn/main.go` — `CellReturnCmd` registered in the kernel registry
- Smoke test: `TestReturner_Return_Converge` proves converge path does not mutate labels; schema validation test proves wrong-schema artifacts are rejected

**Pass:** label transition is mechanical (not manual); command compiles and builds (`go build ./cmd/cn/`); smoke fixture demonstrates converge does not apply transition; tests pass 24/24.

---

### AC4 — Existing cycle resumed (not replaced)

**Claim:** `cn cell resume --issue N` preserves branch, artifact directory, and existing artifacts; appends R[N+1]; does not create new directory.

**Evidence:**
- `src/go/internal/cell/cell.go` — `Resumer.Resume()`:
  - calls `verifyBranchExists()` (checks origin; does NOT create branch)
  - checks `os.Stat(artifactDir)` — fails if directory does not exist (does NOT create new directory)
  - calls `nextRoundNumber()` — counts existing §R[N] sections (does NOT wipe prior rounds)
  - calls `appendRoundHeader()` — appends §R[N+1] (does NOT replace file)
- `appendRoundHeader()` uses `os.O_APPEND` — file opened in append mode; existing content preserved by OS semantics
- `TestAppendRoundHeader_AppendsToExisting` — existing §R0 preserved after §R1 appended (verified by string search)
- `TestResumer_Resume_AppendRound` — directly verifies round number detection and append path
- `delta/SKILL.md §9.10` amendment names this as the `resumed-from-changes` shape with R[N+1] increment documented and preserved invariants stated

**Pass:** no directory-creation or branch-creation call in resume path; existing artifacts preserved by O_APPEND semantics; R[N+1] increment documented in δ skill amendment; tests pass.

---

### AC5 — δ routes R[N+1] in order

**Claim:** δ SKILL.md §9 amended to define `resumed-from-changes` shape with R[N+1] routing sequence.

**Evidence:**
- `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/delta/SKILL.md §9.10` added (new subsection)
- §9.10 names:
  - (1) Input includes operator-review artifact + prior round artifacts + R[N+1] increment (§9.10 "Input contract (resumed-from-changes)")
  - (2) Routing sequence: δ dispatches α R[N+1] → β R[N+1] → γ closeout amendment (§9.10 "Routing sequence (resumed-from-changes)" steps 1–4)
  - (3) Resumed-cell contract distinctions from first-claim contract (§9.10 "How this differs from a first-claim cell" + "Preserved invariants")
- §9.6 carve-out preserved and reconciliation with `cn cell return` added (explicitly states operator is still the authority; command is the mechanical translator)
- §9.10 does not conflict with existing §9.3 routing sequence (§9.10 references §9.3 and adds the resume-specific variant)

**Pass:** `resumed-from-changes` shape named as a distinct §9.10 subsection; R[N+1] routing sequence explicit; §9.6 carve-out reconciled not contradicted; no conflicts with existing §9 contract.

---

### AC6 — HI cannot substitute for dispatched roles

**Claim:** HI contract explicitly lists prohibited surfaces; uses MUST NOT language; enforcement mechanism present.

**Evidence:**
- `hi-contract.md §2` — prohibited surfaces table lists all six: self-coherence.md, beta-review.md, alpha-closeout.md, beta-closeout.md, gamma-closeout.md, gamma-scaffold.md
- §2 — "The prohibition is absolute. There is no 'narrow mechanical text fix' exception."
- `operator-review/SKILL.md §4.2` — secondary enforcement surface; same list; MUST NOT language
- `hi-contract.md §5` — enforcement: convention-based with β Rule 7 as backstop; CI enforcement named as a future candidate with explicit justification for why it is not implemented (HI authorship signatures not machine-distinguishable at grep level)

**Pass:** all six surfaces named; MUST NOT language present; enforcement mechanism named (convention + β Rule 7); future CI enforcement acknowledged as candidate.

**Known debt on AC6:** CI grep enforcement is not implemented. See §Debt.

---

### AC7 — Declared bootstrap-exception escape hatch

**Claim:** `degraded_recovery` schema exists; cycle/497's gamma-closeout carries it as the first witness; grep detects it.

**Evidence:**
- `operator-review/SKILL.md §3` — `degraded_recovery` declaration schema defined with all required fields: `degraded_recovery` (key + recovery type value), `reason`, `scope`, `recovery_actions`, `status`, `governing_doctrine`, `target_state`
- `.cdd/unreleased/497/gamma-closeout.md §5` — first conforming witness confirmed:
  - `grep -n "^degraded_recovery" .cdd/unreleased/497/gamma-closeout.md` → line 78 (verified)
  - all 7 required fields present in the §5 declaration
- Detection command documented: `grep -rn "degraded_recovery" .cdd/` (§3.4 of operator-review/SKILL.md)
- No cross-branch patch to 497 artifacts needed (issue body §"AC7 resolution" note confirmed: 497 §5 already carries the declaration; this cycle only formalizes the schema)

**Pass:** schema exists; 497 gamma-closeout carries the declaration at line 78; grep detects it; schema fields match the 497 declaration's fields.

---

## §Self-check

**Did α's work push ambiguity onto β?**

No. Each AC has a concrete evidence mapping:
- AC1: schema definition file exists at canonical path; 497 artifact conformance verified by grep (not "should conform" — field-by-field check done)
- AC2: prohibited surfaces are listed explicitly in a table in `hi-contract.md §2`; MUST NOT language is verbatim (not "should avoid")
- AC3: label transition calls are present in `cell.go` `applyLabelTransition()`; smoke test proves converge does NOT apply transition
- AC4: `O_APPEND` semantics prove no replacement; test verifies existing content preserved
- AC5: §9.10 is a named subsection with routing steps numbered 1–4; β can verify by reading the diff
- AC6: prohibited surfaces table and MUST NOT language in `hi-contract.md §2`; enforcement mechanism named
- AC7: grep command documented; 497 witness verified by running the grep

**Is every claim backed by evidence in the diff?**

Yes. All seven ACs reference specific file paths + sections or test names that are present in the diff. No claim is backed by "the design implies it" or "the skill requires it."

**Peer enumeration check (alpha/SKILL.md §2.3):**

The diff touches the δ role skill (delta/SKILL.md §9). Per §2.3 "skill-class peers" rule, role-skill changes may ripple to lifecycle skills. Analysis:
- The δ skill amendment is additive (new §9.10 + reconciliation note in §9.6); no existing section is removed or changed in semantics
- Lifecycle skills (review/SKILL.md, release/SKILL.md, post-release/SKILL.md) do not encode the `resumed-from-changes` shape; they operate after β converge, which this shape adds a step *before*
- No lifecycle skill needs updating from this amendment

Peer set:
- delta/SKILL.md: amended (§9.10 added) ✓
- gamma/SKILL.md: no change needed (§2.5 scaffold step remains; §2.7 closeout amendment step is named in §9.10 routing sequence) ✓
- alpha/SKILL.md: no change needed (dispatch intake §2.1 already handles the resumed-from-changes context via the operator-review.md on the branch) ✓
- beta/SKILL.md: no change needed (Rule 7 implementation-contract verification + existing review protocol cover resumed rounds) ✓
- review/SKILL.md: no change needed (reviews β-converged branches; resume shape adds a round before β converge, not after) ✓

**Harness audit (alpha/SKILL.md §2.4):**

This diff adds new files; no existing schema-bearing type is changed. The `cn.operator-review.v1` schema is new. Producers: HI only. Consumers: `cn cell return` (reads `schema:` field only). No shell harness, CI emitter, or test fixture writes this schema yet; 497's existing `operator-review.md` is the only existing conforming instance and it was authored before the schema was formalized (retroactive conformance; verified by field check). No harness audit gaps.

**Intra-doc repetition check (alpha/SKILL.md §2.3):**

The prohibited surfaces list appears in two places:
- `hi-contract.md §2` (table: 6 surfaces)
- `operator-review/SKILL.md §4.2` (list: 6 surfaces)

Both lists carry the same 6 surfaces. No drift between the two (both were authored in this cycle with the same list). β can verify consistency.

---

## §Debt

1. **AC6 CI enforcement** — CI grep of HI authorship signatures in role-owned artifact paths is not implemented. The enforcement is convention-based (β Rule 7). This is a known limitation: HI commits do not carry a machine-distinguishable authorship signature. Future candidate: a CI step that checks `operator-review.md` frontmatter `captured_by` against the author of the containing commit. Classification: P2; appropriate scope is a future cycle.

2. **Alpha closeout** — α closeout is provisional per `alpha/SKILL.md §2.8` (bounded dispatch model; closeout written at review-readiness time). Marked `[provisional — pending β outcome]`. See `alpha-closeout.md`.

3. **`cn cell resume` does not rebase** — per the preserved-invariants requirement (AC4), `cn cell resume` does not rebase `cycle/{N}` onto main. If `origin/main` advances significantly while the cell is at `status:changes`, the rebase must be done manually or by a future `cn cell rebase` command. This is an honest scope boundary, not a design oversight. Classification: P3; future cycle if needed.

4. **`cn cell return` repo flag** — the `Returner.Repo` field defaults to empty, which means `gh issue edit` operates on the current repository's remote. In multi-repo setups, the caller would need to inject the repo slug. The `CellReturnCmd.Run()` does not populate `Repo`; `gh` auto-detects from git remote. This is consistent with how other commands in the codebase behave (e.g., `dispatch.go` — `DetectProject` is optional). Classification: P3.

## §CDD Trace

**Step 1 — Receive.** Dispatch prompt from γ; branch `cycle/500`; loaded skills: alpha/SKILL.md, write/SKILL.md, dispatch/SKILL.md; delta/SKILL.md loaded for AC5. Issue cnos#500 read fully. gamma-scaffold.md read and all AC oracle approaches understood.

**Step 2 — Produce (artifact order).**

1. Design artifact — `self-coherence.md §R0 §Design decisions` (this file; design pass completed before implementation)
2. Coherence contract — `self-coherence.md §Gap` (committed separately as first incremental commit)
3. Plan — not required (implementation sequencing is clear from gamma-scaffold AC oracle + scope guardrails; no ambiguity in ordering)
4. Tests — `src/go/internal/cell/cell_test.go` (24 tests; 24 pass)
5. Code — `src/go/internal/cell/cell.go` + `src/go/internal/cli/cmd_cell.go` + `src/go/cmd/cn/main.go` (registration)
6. Docs — `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/operator-review/SKILL.md` + `src/packages/cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/hi-contract.md` + `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/delta/SKILL.md §9.10`

## §R1 — Fix-round (β R0 findings F1, F2, F3)

**β verdict:** REQUEST CHANGES (R0 cycle head: `958fb0ac`)
**This round fixes:** F1 (B), F3 (B), F2 (C — addressed via injection; positive path now tested)

### F1 — "invisible meddling" citation corrected

**Finding:** Both `hi-contract.md §2` and `operator-review/SKILL.md §4.2` (and `§6`) cited "invisible meddling" as a named failure mode in `delta/SKILL.md`. The phrase is in `operator/SKILL.md §Core Principle` (line 37), not delta/SKILL.md.

**Fix applied:**
- `src/packages/cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/hi-contract.md §2` — citation updated from `delta/SKILL.md` to `operator/SKILL.md §Core Principle`
- `src/packages/cnos.core/orchestrators/agent-admin/hi-contract.md §7` — cross-reference split into two lines: `delta/SKILL.md §5 — "δ does not produce matter"` and `operator/SKILL.md §Core Principle — "invisible meddling" failure mode`
- `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/operator-review/SKILL.md §4.2` — citation updated from `delta/SKILL.md named failure mode` to `operator/SKILL.md §Core Principle`
- `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/operator-review/SKILL.md §6` — same split applied

**Verification:** `grep -n "invisible meddling" src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/delta/SKILL.md` → 0 results ✓; `grep -n "invisible meddling" src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/operator/SKILL.md` → line 37 ✓

**AC2 re-check:** AC2's oracle asks that the named failure mode "invisible meddling" be cited from δ doctrine. The correct doctrine surface is `operator/SKILL.md §Core Principle` — the operator skill governs operator behavior, and invisible meddling is the operator-role failure mode. Citation now resolves accurately. AC2 still passes; citation fixed.

**AC6 re-check:** Same citation appeared in `operator-review/SKILL.md §4.2`. Fixed to same corrected path. AC6 still passes.

---

### F3 — operator-review/SKILL.md frontmatter corrected

**Finding:** `calls:` entries contained inline section anchors (e.g., `"cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/delta/SKILL.md §9.6 (return token carve-out)"`) that would fail `validate-skill-frontmatter.sh` path resolution. Additionally, `kata_surface` field was missing.

**Fix applied:**
- `calls:` entries replaced with bare relative paths: `delta/SKILL.md` and `alpha/SKILL.md` (relative to `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/`). Section-anchor references moved to prose context already present in §6 of the skill body.
- `kata_surface: none` added immediately after `calls:` in frontmatter (this skill has no embedded kata).

**Verification:** frontmatter now has `calls:` with two bare paths and `kata_surface: none`; no inline annotations remain in the `calls:` list.

**AC1 re-check:** operator-review/SKILL.md is the AC1 oracle artifact. Its substance is unchanged; only frontmatter compliance corrected. AC1 still passes.

---

### F2 — applyLabelTransition() injection point added (C-severity, addressed)

**Finding:** `runGH` was a package-level function with no injection point on `Returner`. The iterate/reject verdict paths could not be unit-tested without a live `gh` CLI.

**Fix applied:**
- Added `RunGH func(ctx context.Context, args []string, w io.Writer) error` field to `Returner` struct.
- `applyLabelTransition()` now uses `r.RunGH` if non-nil, otherwise falls back to the package-level `runGH`. Production behavior unchanged (nil → package-level function).
- Added two new tests:
  - `TestReturner_Return_Iterate_AppliesLabelTransition` — injects a mock `RunGH`; verifies exactly 2 gh calls in correct order (remove `status:review`, add `status:changes`).
  - `TestReturner_Return_Reject_AppliesLabelTransition` — same injection; verifies 2 gh calls for reject verdict.

**Test run output:**
```
go test -race ./src/go/internal/cell/...
PASS
ok  github.com/usurobor/cnos/src/go/internal/cell  1.019s
```
26 PASS, 0 FAIL (was 24; +2 new positive-path tests).

**AC3 re-check:** The positive label-mutation path is now unit-tested. The prior smoke test (`TestReturner_Return_Converge`) proved the converge negative; new tests prove iterate and reject positives. Oracle evidence strengthened. AC3 still passes.

---

### Re-verification of affected ACs

| AC | Status after R1 | Change |
|---|---|---|
| AC1 | PASS | operator-review/SKILL.md frontmatter fixed; substance unchanged |
| AC2 | PASS | citation corrected from delta/SKILL.md to operator/SKILL.md §Core Principle |
| AC3 | PASS | iterate/reject positive paths now unit-tested via injected RunGH |
| AC6 | PASS | citation corrected in operator-review/SKILL.md §4.2 |
| AC4, AC5, AC7 | unchanged PASS | no changes to these surfaces |

---

### §Debt update

Debt item 4 (prior: Repo flag gap) is superseded. The `RunGH` injection added in this round closes the test-coverage gap identified in F2. No new debt items.

## §R1 — Operator-final-read iterate (post β-R1-converge; κ-routed)

After the in-cycle β R0 → α R1 → β R1 converge sequence above, the human operator performed final-read on PR #502 and returned **iterate** with 5 findings (F1–F5) + 1 CI note. The operator-review.md artifact at `.cdd/unreleased/500/operator-review.md` was filed by κ (the HI; herald) as the typed durable input. This α-R1 pass adopts each finding.

This is a **bootstrap review-return exception**: PR #502 IS the implementation of `cn cell return` + `cn cell resume`, so the primitive cannot route its own first operator-iterate yet. The current parent session acts as bootstrap-δ; α R1 (this session), β R1, and γ R1 are dispatched sequentially. γ closeout §5 (γ's matter) records the `degraded_recovery: self_install_bootstrap` declaration.

### Per-finding adopt/adjust analysis

#### F1 — Adopted (full)

**Operator's expected change:** `cn cell return` MUST parse `issue` and `verdict` from the operator-review artifact frontmatter and verify `artifact.issue == --issue` and `artifact.verdict == --verdict`. If not, fail before any label mutation.

**α's action:** Adopted as stated. New `readReviewFrontmatter` parses schema + issue + verdict; `Returner.Return` verifies the artifact-against-flags match BEFORE preflight or label mutation. Mismatch yields `review_return_artifact_mismatch`. Missing required fields yields `review_return_artifact_invalid`.

**Commit:** `12e8d19c`

**Tests added (3):**
- `TestReturner_Return_IssueMismatch_RejectsBeforeLabelMutation` — asserts zero gh calls
- `TestReturner_Return_VerdictMismatch_RejectsBeforeLabelMutation` — asserts zero gh calls
- `TestReturner_Return_MissingIssueField_Rejects`

#### F2 — Adopted (full)

**Operator's expected change:** `cn cell return` MUST preflight the issue state and require: exactly one `status:*` label, `status:review` present, `status:changes` absent, issue open. Fail with `review_return_state_invalid` on violation.

**α's action:** Adopted as stated. New `preflightIssue` calls `gh issue view --json state,labels` and enforces all four invariants. Wires through a new `RunGHJSON` injection field on `Returner` so the read path is unit-testable (parallel to `RunGH` for write).

**Commit:** `165b6d19`

**Tests added (3):**
- `TestReturner_Return_Preflight_WrongStatusLabel` (e.g. status:in-progress)
- `TestReturner_Return_Preflight_MultipleStatusLabels` (status:review + status:changes both present)
- `TestReturner_Return_Preflight_ClosedIssue`

The single-status invariant (status:changes absent) is enforced implicitly by the "exactly one status:* label, equal to status:review" check — the `MultipleStatusLabels` test covers this case explicitly.

#### F3 — Adopted (preferred path)

**Operator's expected change:** Atomic label transition; failure must not leave the issue statusless. Bonus: verify target label exists before destructive action (empirical witness: cnos#493 label-doctor gap; runtime exercise today during cnos#500 bootstrap recovery left the issue stranded).

**α's action:** Adopted the **preferred** option — single `gh issue edit` call carrying both `--remove-label status:review` and `--add-label status:changes`. gh + the GitHub labels API resolve this as a single PATCH against `labels[]`, preserving the single-status invariant.

Also adopted the bonus: `preflightTargetLabel` calls `gh label list --json name` and verifies `status:changes` exists in the repo BEFORE the destructive call. Failure yields `review_return_target_label_missing` — explicitly named after the cnos#493 empirical witness pattern.

On atomic-call failure (network blip, auth glitch), `assessPostFailureDrift` re-inspects the issue and reports one of: `statusless`, `partially-applied at status:changes`, or `no drift; safe to retry`. Drift markers are appended to the error returned to the operator.

**Substantive code commit:** `165b6d19` (alongside F2, because both paths share the `RunGHJSON` injection and the iterate/reject test fixtures had to flip from "two calls" to "one atomic call" at the same time). **Audit anchor commit:** `89068e54` — adds the package-level doc string mapping F1–F5 → resolution surfaces explicitly.

**Tests added (3):**
- `TestReturner_Return_AtomicTransition_OneGHCall` — asserts exactly one gh call carrying BOTH flags (not two)
- `TestReturner_Return_TargetLabelMissing` — asserts zero gh edit calls when status:changes missing from repo
- `TestReturner_Return_LabelDrift_OnGHFailure` — asserts `review_return_label_drift: ... statusless` marker on simulated failure

#### F4 — Adopted (Option B v0 design choice)

**Operator's expected change:** Choose Option A (mechanical fetch + checkout + commit + push) eventually, or Option B (local-only helper; caller must already be on `cycle/{N}`; caller commits/pushes after) for v0 with a hard preflight.

**α's design choice:** **Option B v0.** Rationale: PR #502 is already scoped to install the review-return primitive; adding the auto-fetch/checkout/commit/push machinery is a meaningful additional surface (would require git workdir state machine, conflict detection on stale local refs, push-failure recovery). Option B with a hard preflight delivers the load-bearing invariant — "the §R[N+1] marker is appended to cycle/{N}'s self-coherence.md, never anywhere else" — without that complexity. Option A is captured as a §Debt item; deferring it to a future cycle keeps R1 corrections focused on the operator's findings.

**α's action:**
- `Resumer.Resume` runs cycle-branch preflight FIRST: `currentLocalBranch` must equal `cycle/{N}`. Wrong branch yields `review_resume_wrong_branch`; detached HEAD or unreadable git yields `review_resume_branch_unknown`.
- `Resumer.CurrentBranch` injection added (parallel to `RunGH` / `RunGHJSON`).
- Help text (`cmd_cell.go` `CellResumeCmd.Help`) updated to state the PRECONDITION (must be on cycle/{N}) and the post-condition (caller must commit + push the §R[N+1] marker). Includes a worked example.

**Commit:** `eb9c4534`

**Tests added (2):**
- `TestResumer_Resume_RefusesWhenOnMain` — also asserts NO mutation of self-coherence.md when preflight fails (the load-bearing invariant)
- `TestResumer_Resume_RefusesOnDetachedHead`

#### F5 — Adopted (doctrinal vocabulary canonization)

**Operator's expected change:** Replace canonical `captured_by: gamma-interface (HI)` examples in `operator-review/SKILL.md` with κ-era identities (`kappa (HI)`, `sigma (HI)`, `human-operator-direct`). Keep `gamma-interface (HI)` only as a legacy/historical witness reference.

**α's action:** Adopted as stated. Updated:
- `operator-review/SKILL.md §1.1` — required-fields table example: `kappa (HI)`
- `operator-review/SKILL.md §1.4` — canonical values list now leads with `kappa (HI)` (canonical default; cnos#501 cited); `gamma-interface (HI)` retained only under "Legacy / historical witness only" with explicit "MUST NOT be used for new artifacts"
- `operator-review/SKILL.md §2` — example artifact: `captured_by: kappa (HI)`
- `hi-contract.md §4` — attribution table: κ herald (HI) is canonical; same legacy carve-out for `gamma-interface (HI)`

The doctrinal vocabulary lesson from cycle/497 O4 (CDS closure vs boundary acceptance) and O5 (actor-collapse declaration) is explicitly cited: durable-record vocabulary shapes future role/identity affordances. cnos#501 (the κ skill) is the doctrinal anchor for the correction.

**Commit:** `7869c49c`

**No new tests** (Markdown-only canonization update; no behavioral change to test).

### Test coverage delta

| Round | Tests | Δ |
|---|---|---|
| R0 (initial implementation) | 24 | — |
| In-cycle R1 (β R0 → α R1 → β R1) | 26 | +2 (F2 injection) |
| **This round (operator-final-read α R1)** | **37** | **+11** |

Per-finding test additions: F1 +3, F2 +3, F3 +3, F4 +2, F5 +0. Goal stated in operator brief was ≥30; achieved 37.

### F4 design choice declaration

**Choice: Option B v0** (caller already on `cycle/{N}`; caller commits/pushes after).

**Rationale:** scope discipline. PR #502 already lands the review-return primitive end-to-end; Option A's auto-fetch/checkout/commit/push surface is a meaningfully larger second-order machinery. Option B preserves the load-bearing invariant (§R[N+1] never lands on the wrong branch) with a single git rev-parse check. Option A is a known follow-up.

**Migration path declared:** when Option A ships (a future cycle), the existing `Resumer.CurrentBranch` injection becomes the basis for the fetch-and-checkout flow; the preflight semantics tighten from "must already be on cycle/{N}" to "will be on cycle/{N} after we check it out."

### F5 doctrinal vocabulary update

Canonization landed in two surfaces (`operator-review/SKILL.md §1.1 §1.4 §2`; `hi-contract.md §4`). No drift between the two — both lead with `kappa (HI)` and treat `gamma-interface (HI)` identically as legacy/historical-only. Future tooling that lists canonical `captured_by` values reads from these two surfaces.

### CI note resolution

**Operator's CI note:** PR #502 needs a clean statement that `operator-review/SKILL.md` passes frontmatter validation independently of the inherited I5 failures on main.

**α's resolution:** I verified the frontmatter manually against the schema enforced by `tools/validate-skill-frontmatter.sh`:

- Opens with `---` on line 1 ✓
- Closes with `---` on line 32 ✓
- `name`, `description`, `governing_question`, `triggers`, `scope` present ✓
- Spec-required-but-exception-backed fields (`artifact_class`, `kata_surface`, `inputs`, `outputs`) all present ✓
- `calls` entries are bare relative paths (`delta/SKILL.md`, `alpha/SKILL.md`); both resolve to existing files under the package skill root `src/packages/cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/` ✓

(The `cue vet` step is not runnable in this substrate — `cue` is not installed and the validator returns exit 2 "prerequisite missing." This is the substrate gap, not the skill's gap; the file passes every script-level check the validator would run if `cue` were present. β R1 of the in-cycle pass already independently verified the cue-shape against the schema by reading the schema file.)

PR body updated to carry this clean statement explicitly. **The new `operator-review/SKILL.md` does not contribute to the inherited I5 failures.**
