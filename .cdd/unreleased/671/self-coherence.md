## Issue

[#671 — PC — plan the cell-runtime doctrine wave (CM-grounded)](https://github.com/usurobor/cnos/issues/671).
Parent wave #627. This is a **Planning Cell (PC)**: its telos is a
`cn.wave.v1` relation graph (six Working-Cell contracts) that guides
future WC work, not a `docs/` artifact and not a release. The live matter
is **PR #672**, branch `wave/671-cell-runtime-doctrine`.

## Mode

**Bootstrap Planning Cell, §5.2-adjacent (wave-producing), doctrine.**
This cell *authors the cell-runtime doctrine itself* — the classes, the
contract envelope, the FSMs, the migration, the seal — which is the very
machinery that, once implemented (#627 S2–S8), will mechanically
constitute and separate cell roles. The cell therefore **predates the
runtime that would constitute it**. That is the bootstrap paradox this
exemption names rather than papers over.

## Gap

The measured incoherence this cell reduces (grounding CM, content-bound
`sha256:9d1ab3a5…` capture of `cnos#667#issuecomment-5015460988`):

> The cell-runtime doctrine existed as scattered, partially-contradictory
> surfaces (#628/S1 runtime loop, #662 cell classes, CELL-KINDS.md,
> shipped `schemas/cdd/*.cue`) with no single mechanically-checkable
> decomposition a Working Cell could execute without inventing
> dependency, measurement, authority, gate, migration, or closure policy.

The cell closes the gap by producing one revision-bound, content-addressed
graph of six executable `cn.cell.contract.v1` Working-Cell contracts
(WC-2 → WC-1 → {WC-3a · WC-3b · WC-4} → WC-5), each grounded in the
measured incoherence, with a total assurance registry and a materialized
wave-boundary pre-authorization gate.

## ACs (cell telos → evidence)

| AC | Claim | Evidence (reviewed matter @ `614829a4`) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Six-node `cn.wave.v1` construction graph, single keystone root WC-2 | `.cdd/waves/cell-runtime-doctrine/wave.cn-wave-v1.yaml`; external-β independently derived 12 edges = 12 authored, sole root WC-2 |
| 2 | Six complete `cn.cell.contract.v1` Working-Cell contracts | `contracts/wc-{1,2,3a,3b,4,5}.cn-cell-contract-v1.yaml`; each carries inputs/output/surface/acceptance/STOP/gate/evidence-ownership |
| 3 | Structural assurance (CUE) | `schema/*.cue` + 31 negative regressions; `make -C schema all` → exit 0, all 31 negatives reject |
| 4 | Wave-boundary pre-authorization gate (Go, CUE-normalized) | `wave-validators/oracle_ownership_bijection.go`; `make -C wave-validators all` → exit 0; 78 ⇄ 78 ownership bijection, 30 mechanically-verifiable |
| 5 | Total assurance registry, every child predicate classified once | `oracle-registry.yaml`; whole-wave properties owned at the wave boundary |
| 6 | Content-addressed grounding + honest transitional intent | `grounding-cm.md`, `grounding-source-5015460988.md`, `intent.cn-intent-v1.yaml`, `decision-provenance.md` |
| 7 | #627 reconciliation (doctrine layer feeds S2–S8, not a fork) | `reconcile-627.md` |

## CDD Trace

- **α (matter production):** performed by **Sigma-at-repo** across rounds
  R1→R16 under bootstrap role-collapse (see `## Known debt` item 1). The
  matter is the wave under `.cdd/waves/cell-runtime-doctrine/`, frozen at
  the reviewed revision.
- **β (independent review):** performed by a **genuinely external
  reviewer of different model lineage** ("Codex", posting as `usurobor`),
  content-bound to the exact reviewed SHA each round. Terminal verdict
  **CONVERGE at R16 / `614829a4`** — no BLOCKER or REQUIRED defect.
  Captured **byte-exact** in `beta-review-source-5076109763.md` (raw-body
  sha256 `75cdb9b6…`, 9,894 bytes), with κ metadata in the separate
  envelope `beta-review.md` (R17 repair — the prior capture was an
  excerpt, corrected here).
- **γ (closure):** performed by a **distinct non-κ actor** — see
  `gamma-closeout.md`. The earlier κ-signed γ closeout
  ([PR #672 comment 5076124652](https://github.com/usurobor/cnos/pull/672#issuecomment-5076124652))
  is **retracted as void** (κ must not perform γ; firebreak). This is the
  load-bearing repair of the CC HOLD.
- **CC (process judgment):** returned **HOLD** on the κ-signed γ + missing
  constitution. This artifact set + the non-κ γ + the exemption are the
  response; a fresh external-CC judgment runs against the new head before
  operator authorization.
- **κ (control-plane / Herald):** Sigma-at-repo coordinated the review,
  pushed revisions, and captured evidence. κ is **outside** the cell and
  authors no in-cell judgment.

## Self-check

| Row | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Matter frozen (`matter_sha` `614829a4`) | yes | `.cdd/waves/cell-runtime-doctrine/**` byte-identical to `614829a4`; this cycle adds only `.cdd/unreleased/671/**`; receipt head is a distinct `receipt_head` above the frozen matter |
| β evidence byte-exact + content-bound | yes | `beta-review-source-5076109763.md` reproduces the source raw body byte-for-byte (sha256 `75cdb9b6…`, 9,894 bytes); envelope `beta-review.md` binds comment id + reviewed SHA |
| γ not by κ (durable provenance) | yes | `gamma-dispatch.md` binds the γ activation identity + frozen inputs + output hash; `gamma-closeout.md` is the output; κ only transports. **Git author metadata is not the proof.** Void κ-signed closeout retracted on PR |
| 3.11b discoverable | yes | `## Protocol exemption` in #671 body (recovery path (b)) |
| exemption revision-bound | yes | snapshot `protocol-exemption-source.md` (sha256 `dccba69c…`) + envelope `protocol-exemption.md`; gate fails stale if the live issue exemption diverges |
| firebreak κ≠α stated | yes (as bootstrap debt) | `## Known debt` item 1; named, not hidden |
| No witness theater | yes | no fabricated multi-actor history; collapse recorded truthfully; role claims rest on input→output binding, not labels |

## Known debt

1. **Bootstrap role-collapse (α/κ/δ fused in one Sigma session).** Per
   `delta/SKILL.md` §9.1, bootstrap-δ legitimately collapses γ-driver with
   δ-orchestrator and spawns roles as sub-sessions; this cell went further
   and fused α authorship with the κ/δ control plane. This is an
   **empirical bootstrap case, not the target architecture** — the target
   is exactly what this wave specifies (the generic cell runner of #627,
   which mechanically separates the roles). Debt is discharged structurally
   by shipping that runtime; named here so the collapse is auditable.
2. **γ was initially performed by κ — a firebreak violation.** Corrected:
   the void closeout is retracted and γ is re-performed by a distinct
   non-κ actor (`gamma-closeout.md`). The general fix is the FSM/role
   separation the wave itself specifies (WC-3a/WC-3b).
3. **README historical tail (`README.md:408-411`) names R13→R14 as the
   prior round** — a stale historical projection. External-β left it as a
   deliberate OBSERVATION ("do not mutate the converged R16 matter"); it is
   carried as debt for a later authorized documentation pass, **not**
   repaired here (repairing it would break the freeze / seal).

## R17 — receipt-layer repair (external-β ITERATE, comment 5076629728)

External-β returned **ITERATE** on the first receipt head (`7a8ec483`) with three
correct boundary-evidence findings (matter unchanged, still CONVERGED). R17 fixes
the **receipt layer only** — the frozen matter stays byte-identical to `614829a4`:

| β finding | R17 repair |
|---|---|
| [BLOCKER] git-author string ≠ distinct non-κ γ actor | `gamma-dispatch.md` binds durable γ activation provenance (activation identity + exact frozen inputs + γ output hash); κ transports only; git-author metadata explicitly disclaimed as proof. The γ activation is a **distinct in-host activation** that re-derives evidence from frozen inputs and could return HOLD — the strongest γ-independence available in a manual bootstrap (β carries the different-lineage independence). |
| [REQUIRED] β capture is an excerpt, not full verbatim | `beta-review-source-5076109763.md` is now **byte-exact** to the source (sha256 `75cdb9b6…`, 9,894 bytes, all nine `##` sections in order); κ metadata moved to the `beta-review.md` envelope. |
| [REQUIRED] mutable exemption not revision-bound; PR conflates matter/receipt SHA | exemption snapshotted + hashed (`protocol-exemption.md`, `dccba69c…`) with a fail-stale gate rule; `matter_sha` (`614829a4`) vs `receipt_head` distinguished here and in the PR body. |

## Review-readiness | bootstrap PC · R17 | frozen `matter_sha` `614829a4682e148d98c70371e600ffdc3fa6386e` (R16) | receipt layer under `.cdd/unreleased/671/` | ready for durable-provenance γ re-run + external-β re-review + external-CC
