# α self-coherence — cycle/100

**Issue:** cnos#100 — "B9b: memory as a first-class retention faculty — contract, skill, recall + write protocol"
**Branch:** `cycle/100` from `origin/main@5e8cafdb`
**Mode:** design-and-build (per γ scaffold §1.1 + §8)
**α:** `alpha@cdd.cnos`
**Author:** α session 2026-05-20

This file is written incrementally per `alpha/SKILL.md §2.5`, one section per commit.

## §Gap

The named gap (from #100 body):

> cnos agents have persistence in practice (reflections, adhoc threads, hub state, git history, runtime contract) but not memory as a named faculty. There is no canonical answer to: what to read at session start, what to write back, what counts as durable, what is only runtime projection.

The cycle's MCA: make memory a faculty by adding (1) a runtime-contract field under `cognition`, (2) an agent skill that owns the recall + write protocol, (3) a `cn status` + `cn doctor` projection, (4) a fresh-session runbook with a single canonical entrypoint. γ's scaffold §2 confirmed all proposed surfaces are net-new (grep-verified absences); the cycle does not rename / repurpose existing surfaces.

ε framing (from scaffold §1) — this cycle is the MCA against the receipt-stream pattern: the memory problem prevents the agent from remembering there's a memory problem. Mode: design-and-build. Design converges in the issue body + γ scaffold + this file; no separate DESIGN.md.

Path-coordination (scaffold §1.1 decision (b)): this cycle ships the skill at `src/packages/cnos.core/skills/agent/memory/SKILL.md`. #101 B14a renames `agent/` → `self/` mechanically post-merge.

---

## §Skills

Active skill set (per γ dispatch + scaffold §1.2):

| Tier | Skill | Where it constrained authoring |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `cnos.cdd/skills/cdd/alpha/SKILL.md` | role contract + load order + pre-review gate (this file's structure) |
| 1 | `cnos.core/doctrine/KERNEL.md §1.4 Memory` | memory faculty doctrine context |
| 2 | `cnos.eng/skills/eng/document/SKILL.md` | MEMORY.md runbook + RUNTIME-CONTRACT-v2.md schema doc form |
| 2 | `cnos.eng/skills/eng/ocaml/SKILL.md` | OCaml type extension + emitter authoring |
| 2 | `cnos.eng/skills/eng/go/SKILL.md` | doctor + hubstatus authoring (table-driven tests, eng/go §2.18 dispatch boundary respected) |
| 3 | `cnos.core/skills/skill/SKILL.md` | meta-skill conformance for the new memory skill (Define → Unfold → Rules → Verify → Kata; declared `artifact_class: skill`, `kata_surface: embedded`) |
| 3 | `cnos.core/skills/agent/reflect/SKILL.md` | referenced by path from new memory skill; not edited (non-goal #3) |
| 3 | `cnos.core/skills/ops/adhoc-thread/SKILL.md` | referenced by path from new memory skill; not edited (non-goal #3) |

MEMORY.md v0.2.0 supersession (scaffold §2.3): read as historical context for the lean-triadic α/β/γ memory-class framing; #100 supersedes its §3 / §Alternatives rejection of an agent/memory skill. The supersession is documented in MEMORY.md's new §Supersession block as a paired-state table (v0.2.0 position ↔ post-#100 position ↔ why).

---

## §ACs

AC text is #100 verbatim. Evidence is named at file:line where appropriate; behavioural evidence (test runs) cites the runner output.

### AC1 — Runtime contract declares `memory` under `cognition`

> Runtime contract declares `memory` under `cognition` as a retention faculty. Fields: `backend` (e.g. `git+threads+state`), `entrypoint` (canonical restore surface), `surfaces` (readable/writable paths), `freshness` (last-update / staleness signal), `scope` (what memory is expected to preserve).

**Met.** Evidence:

- `src/ocaml/lib/cn_contract.ml:124-148` — new `type memory` record `{backend; entrypoint; surfaces; freshness; scope}`; `cognition` record extended with `memory : memory` field. Pure-type module; no IO.
- `src/ocaml/cmd/cn_runtime_contract.ml:73-87` — type re-export mirror (Cn_contract.memory = …) preserves the type-equality syntax discipline so existing callers continue to resolve through Cn_runtime_contract.
- `src/ocaml/cmd/cn_runtime_contract.ml:222-281` — `memory_state ~hub_path` helper: derives `freshness` from filesystem mtime over `threads/reflections/{daily,weekly}` + `threads/adhoc/`; renders as "most-recent: N days ago" / "no memory activity"; v1 defaults for backend (`git+threads+state`), entrypoint, surfaces, scope.
- `src/ocaml/cmd/cn_runtime_contract.ml:368-374` — `gather` threads `memory` into the `cognition` construction.
- `src/ocaml/cmd/cn_runtime_contract.ml:455-465` — `render_markdown` writes a `memory:` block after `active_overrides` with the five fields (preserves prompt-cache-stable deterministic ordering).
- `src/ocaml/cmd/cn_runtime_contract.ml:563-571` — `to_json` serializes `cognition.memory` as a JSON object with the five fields.
- `docs/alpha/agent-runtime/RUNTIME-CONTRACT-v2.md` §2.2 (Cognition table + sub-shape table); §4 (JSON example with cognition.memory block); §5 (Markdown rendering with memory lines); §6 (doctor validation note for checkMemoryEntrypoint + 30-day threshold).

Peers updated:
- Type-construction sites: `test/lib/cn_contract_pure_test.ml:195-225` (CG1) and `:262-282` (RC1) — both record literals updated; `dune runtest test/lib` exit 0.
- The two type-equality-mirror sites (`cn_contract.ml` + `cn_runtime_contract.ml`) both received the new field.

### AC2 — Agent skill at canonical role-skill location

> Agent skill at the canonical role-skill location (post-B14a rename: `self/memory/SKILL.md`; pre-rename: `agent/memory/SKILL.md`) defines: storage taxonomy, write triggers, recall triggers, indexing/restore discipline.

**Met.** Evidence:

- `src/packages/cnos.core/skills/agent/memory/SKILL.md` — 326 lines, conforms to `cnos.core/skills/skill/SKILL.md` meta-skill (Define → Unfold → Rules → Verify → Kata; declares `artifact_class: skill`, `kata_surface: embedded`, governing question).
- Storage taxonomy at §2.1 (table form: surface ↔ owner ↔ contains).
- Write triggers enumerated at §2.3 (six trigger types; AC5-verbatim).
- Recall triggers enumerated at §2.2 (five trigger types; AC4-verbatim).
- Indexing/restore discipline at §2.4 (typed frontmatter relationships `relates_to`, `supersedes`, `derived_from`).
- Length is within the sibling-skill band (~300–500 lines per scaffold §6.2); siblings under `cnos.core/skills/agent/` range 24–497 lines, median ~110.
- `.gitignore` adjusted: top-level `memory/` rule (hub-instance protection) broadly matched the skill path; added `!src/packages/cnos.core/skills/agent/memory/**` negation so the skill is trackable while hub-instance memory/ stays ignored.

### AC3 — Storage taxonomy

> Storage taxonomy: `threads/reflections/` owned by `reflect`; `threads/adhoc/` owned by `adhoc-thread`; memory index/restore entrypoint owned by `memory`; `state/` is runtime projection (not canonical retained memory).

**Met.** Evidence:

- Memory skill §2.1 (table form): `threads/reflections/` → `reflect`; `threads/adhoc/` → `adhoc-thread`; `state/conversation.json` → runtime (working continuity, not canonical); `state/` (other) → runtime projection, not memory.
- MEMORY.md runbook §1 mirrors the same taxonomy.
- Rule 3.3 ("Treat `state/` as projection, not memory") enforces the projection ↔ memory distinction with ❌/✅.
- `reflect` and `adhoc-thread` are referenced by path only — not edited (non-goal #3 preserved).

### AC4 — Recall protocol

> Recall protocol: minimum triggers documented (session start; before answering about prior work / dates / decisions / status; before planning / reprioritizing; before filing or updating issues; after corrections that may change future behavior).

**Met.** Evidence:

- Memory skill §2.2 enumerates all five triggers verbatim.
- §2.2 closes with the recall-surface scope: "hub threads + workspace doctrine/design docs" (April-26 evidence point 1 — the highest-leverage gap is the *surface* widening, captured here).
- MEMORY.md runbook §2 prescribes the ordered reads (runtime contract → runbook → owning skill → latest daily → weekly → adhoc → workspace doctrine).
- Memory skill rule 3.1 ("Read the canonical entrypoint at session start") + rule 3.7 ("Restore covers workspace docs too") embed the protocol as imperative rules.

### AC5 — Write protocol

> Write protocol: minimum triggers (after shipping work; after corrections / MCIs; after making or changing a plan; after learning something behavior-changing; before session end / compaction risk; cadence reflection).

**Met.** Evidence:

- Memory skill §2.3 enumerates all six triggers verbatim.
- §2.3 prescribes cnos#386's two-part shape as the canonical minimum structure (scaffold §3 AC5 γ note): Part A (in-line MCA receipts at decision time, with full receipt format) + Part B (structured session-close gate with the six-field schema `artifact_refs` / `debt_refs` / `decision_refs` / `learnings_refs` / `memory_refs` / `upstream_pending`).
- Rule 3.9 ("Write the close-out receipt before exit") makes Part B non-optional when the session produced any artifact / decision / learning.
- Out-of-scope items (automated EOD transcript extraction, contradiction detection) are documented as known debt in §5, not implemented (non-goal #1 preserved; scaffold §6.1).

### AC6 — `cn status` + `cn doctor` surfaces

> `cn status` surfaces memory state. `cn doctor` (post-B10a) can report missing/stale memory entrypoint.

**Met.** Evidence:

- `src/go/internal/hubstatus/hubstatus.go:38-50` — `Run` calls `showMemory` after `showPackages`.
- `src/go/internal/hubstatus/hubstatus.go:54-101` — `showMemory` reads `state/runtime-contract.json`, projects `cognition.memory` as a Memory section. Three states: contract absent → pending; unparseable → pending (diagnostic); present → render five fields.
- `src/go/internal/hubstatus/hubstatus_test.go:217-280` — two new tests: `TestRunMemoryPending` (contract absent), `TestRunMemoryFromContract` (happy-path projection).
- `src/go/internal/doctor/doctor.go:121-126` — `RunAll` calls `checkMemoryEntrypoint`.
- `src/go/internal/doctor/doctor.go:343-394` — `checkMemoryEntrypoint` implementation. Three-state semantics: missing entrypoint → StatusFail; present with no thread activity or stale (most-recent > 30 days) → StatusInfo; fresh → StatusPass. 30-day threshold literal surfaced in the value text.
- `src/go/internal/doctor/doctor_test.go:218-322` — four new tests covering all four states (Missing, PresentNoActivity, Fresh, Stale). The Stale test asserts the literal "30" appears in the value text (scaffold §6.5 happy-path + unhappy-path coverage).
- `go test ./...` exit 0 (all 13 packages; cached after first run).

### AC7 — Fresh-session restore entrypoint

> Fresh-session restore has one named entrypoint instead of ad-hoc file probing. Verified by a runbook in `docs/alpha/agent-runtime/MEMORY.md` (or equivalent).

**Met.** Evidence:

- `docs/alpha/agent-runtime/MEMORY.md` rewritten as the runbook (per scaffold §3 AC7 γ recommendation). §0 names the gap; §1 names the three surfaces and the entrypoint; §2 prescribes the ordered reads; §3 carries the write-protocol short form (full form in the skill); §4 names the index discipline; §5 names the freshness signal semantics; §6 enumerates known debt.
- v0.2.0 design lineage preserved in §Supersession (paired-state table: v0.2.0 position ↔ post-#100 position ↔ why; what v0.2.0 got right and #100 preserves).
- Mutual reference: memory skill names the runbook as the canonical entrypoint; runbook names the skill as the discipline. Runtime contract's `cognition.memory.entrypoint` points at the skill (the installed file every hub has); the runbook is named in the skill body and in the schema doc. Both surfaces agree on the canonical entrypoint (scaffold §6.3 consistency check).

---

## §Self-check

Did α's work push ambiguity onto β? Is every claim backed by evidence in the diff?

**Schema-bearing harness audit (alpha/SKILL.md §2.4 + scaffold §6.4).** The cognition record is schema-bearing. Enumerated every producer/consumer before claiming closure.

`Cn_contract.cognition` (OCaml record type):
- Producer: `cn_runtime_contract.ml:gather` (one site, updated).
- Consumers (code): `cn_runtime_contract.ml:render_markdown` + `to_json` (both updated to handle the new field).
- Consumers (re-export type-equality mirror): `cn_runtime_contract.ml` (updated with the new field; type equality preserved).
- Consumers (tests): `test/lib/cn_contract_pure_test.ml` CG1 + RC1 record literals (both updated). `test/cmd/cn_runtime_contract_test.ml` consumes `c.cognition.packages` only (no destructure; not affected by the new field) — confirmed by inspection of the test file.
- Doc-only references (no record access): `cn_context.ml:150` (prompt text), `cn_activation.ml:9,68` (docstrings). Not affected.

`state/runtime-contract.json` (JSON shape):
- Producer: `cn_runtime_contract.ml:to_json` (one site, updated to emit `cognition.memory`).
- Consumers (Go): `doctor.go:checkRuntimeContract` checks top-level keys only (cognition presence, not sub-shape) — not affected by adding sub-keys. New consumer `hubstatus.go:showMemory` reads `cognition.memory` — covered by `TestRunMemoryFromContract`.
- Consumers (OCaml legacy): `cn_system.ml:199-218` (alternate doctor) — checks top-level keys only; not affected.
- Consumers (tests): `doctor_test.go` fixtures use `cognition: map[string]any{}` placeholder — sub-shape additions do not break these tests; verified by passing test run.

**Caller-path trace for new modules (alpha/SKILL.md row 12).** Every new function has a non-test caller:

| New module/function | Non-test caller | Call site |
|---|---|---|
| `Cn_runtime_contract.memory_state` | `Cn_runtime_contract.gather` | `cn_runtime_contract.ml` (gather threads `memory` into cognition) |
| `doctor.checkMemoryEntrypoint` | `doctor.RunAll` | `doctor.go` (added after `checkRuntimeContract`) |
| `doctor.newestMtimeIn` | `doctor.checkMemoryEntrypoint` | `doctor.go` (helper) |
| `hubstatus.showMemory` | `hubstatus.Run` | `hubstatus.go` (added between `showPackages` and `showCommands`) |

**Peer enumeration (alpha/SKILL.md §2.3).** The cycle touches a family of peers across OCaml + Go + docs. Enumerated in the scaffold §5 code-peer table; verified each was updated or explicitly exempted:

| Peer (scaffold §5) | Status |
|---|---|
| `src/ocaml/lib/cn_contract.ml` | Updated — new `memory` record + cognition field |
| `src/ocaml/cmd/cn_runtime_contract.ml` | Updated — mirror + gather + render + to_json + new helper |
| `src/go/internal/doctor/doctor.go` | Updated — new check + helper + constants |
| `src/go/internal/doctor/doctor_test.go` | Updated — 4 new tests + 2 helpers |
| `src/go/internal/hubstatus/hubstatus.go` | Updated — new Memory section |
| `src/go/internal/hubstatus/hubstatus_test.go` | Updated — 2 new tests |
| `src/packages/cnos.core/skills/agent/memory/SKILL.md` | New — AC2-AC5 skill |
| `docs/alpha/agent-runtime/RUNTIME-CONTRACT-v2.md` | Updated — §2.2 table + §4 JSON + §5 markdown + §6 doctor note |
| `docs/alpha/agent-runtime/MEMORY.md` | Updated — runbook rewrite + §Supersession |
| `kata/` content for the new skill | Not required — embedded kata at skill §6 (per meta-skill §2.4 `kata_surface: embedded`) |

Intra-doc repetition check (alpha/SKILL.md §2.3 second clause): grepped for `cognition.memory` across the diff to confirm consistent shape:
- `cn_contract.ml`: 1 type definition site
- `cn_runtime_contract.ml`: 1 mirror, 1 helper output, 1 gather construction, 1 render block, 1 to_json block — all five fields consistent
- `doctor.go`: 1 constant + 1 dir scan + 1 check; entrypoint constant matches OCaml literal
- `hubstatus.go`: 1 JSON read; field names match emitter
- `RUNTIME-CONTRACT-v2.md`: 1 sub-shape table + 1 JSON example + 1 markdown example — all five fields consistent
- `MEMORY.md`: 1 JSON example — all five fields consistent

Same-shape verification: OCaml emitter `memory_state` defaults align field-for-field with `MEMORY.md` §1 example and `RUNTIME-CONTRACT-v2.md` §4 example. The five fields are the contract; downstream renderers (markdown + Go) consume them uniformly.

**Test assertion count from runner output (alpha/SKILL.md row 13).** Verified via `go test -v`:

- `internal/doctor`: 4 new Memory tests, all PASS. Pre-existing 11 tests still PASS.
- `internal/hubstatus`: 2 new Memory tests, all PASS. Pre-existing 7 tests still PASS.
- OCaml `test/lib runtest`: exit 0 (CG1 and RC1 record-literal updates verified).

No claim of "N assertions added" is made — the test runner's PASS lines are the authority.

**Skill-class peers (alpha/SKILL.md §2.3 — skill-class enumeration).** The diff adds a new role-adjacent skill at `cnos.core/skills/agent/memory/`. Checked the skill-class corpus:

- Role skills (`alpha/`, `beta/`, `gamma/`, `operator/`) — not modified. The new memory skill is an agent skill, not a role skill; no role contract change rippled.
- Lifecycle skills (`review/`, `release/`, `post-release/`, `design/`, `plan/`, `issue/`) — not modified. No role-contract changes that would force lifecycle drift.
- Agent skills (`reflect`, `adhoc-thread`) — explicitly referenced by path; not modified (non-goal #3).
- Meta-skill (`cnos.core/skills/skill/SKILL.md`) — used as the authoring constraint; not modified.

**Ambiguity check.** Things β should be able to verify mechanically without additional context:
- AC1 producer/consumer enumeration above
- AC6 test coverage (happy + unhappy) — explicit
- Caller-path trace — explicit
- 30-day threshold literal — observable in `doctor.go:memoryStaleDays` constant + test assertion + value text
- Mutual agreement between skill and runbook on canonical entrypoint — both name the same `.cn/vendor/.../memory/SKILL.md` path
- Branch is rebased onto origin/main (merge-base == origin/main; verified at sign-off time)
- Commit author email is `alpha@cdd.cnos` on all four α commits

## §Debt

Explicit known debt the cycle does not close, and the reason each is left as debt rather than fixed in-scope:

### In-scope known debt (cycle-internal)

1. **Existing adhoc-thread corpus is not retrofitted.** The skill prescribes typed frontmatter relationships (`relates_to`, `supersedes`, `derived_from`) as a rule going forward; existing adhoc threads stay un-migrated. Reason: scaffold §3 AC2 γ note explicitly scope-guards the cycle to ships-rule, not ship-migration; corpus migration is downstream (candidate B9c / #35).
2. **Automated EOD transcript extraction not implemented.** AC5 Part B (structured session-close gate) is a manual checklist in v1. Reason: scaffold §3 AC5 γ note + non-goal #1 (no automation backend) — discipline must exist before tooling can enforce it.
3. **Contradiction detection at write time not implemented.** Reason: scaffold §3 AC5 γ note marks this out of scope; semantic scan is a future MCA candidate.
4. **Retrieval backend (Memory Palace–style) not implemented.** Reason: scaffold §6.1 + non-goal #1 — no vector index, embedding store, or knowledge graph in v1. The `cognition.memory.backend` field is open-string so future backends can populate without contract change.

### Adjacent debt (pre-existing, surfaced by this cycle)

5. **OCaml dune build had a latent path bug from the abf651b0 refactor (2026-04-11).** `src/ocaml/lib/dune` referenced `../../VERSION` and `../../cn.json` which resolve to `src/VERSION` and `src/cn.json` (these files live at the repo root, not in src/). Without the fix, dune build cannot compile cn_contract.ml at all. **Patched in this cycle** (`../../` → `../../../`) because the type-coherence verification scaffold §6.4 requires `dune build` to actually run. This is a one-line mechanical fix consistent with the refactor's intent; α deliberately did NOT take on the broader OCaml-stack repair (see #6 below). The fix is enclosed in commit `f1ccef25` and called out in the commit message.
6. **OCaml `test/cmd/dune` references a non-existent extension binary** (`src/agent/extensions/cnos.net.http/host/cnos-ext-http`). Pre-existing dependency drift: the cnos.net.http extension no longer exists in the tree but the test still names it. This blocks `dune runtest test/cmd` (the cn_extension_test library's inline-tests deps cannot resolve). Result: the OCaml-side `cn_runtime_contract_test` (which exercises `gather` / `render_markdown` / `to_json` end-to-end) cannot be run via `dune runtest test/cmd` in this cycle. **Not fixed** here — it is a clear pre-existing breakage unrelated to #100, and the extensions feature appears to have been removed. Type-coherence of the cycle's emitter changes is verified by `dune build` (exit 0) + `dune runtest test/lib` (CG1 + RC1 cover the cognition + memory record-literal compile path); the deeper functional test would land in a follow-up cycle that cleans up `test/cmd/dune`. CI does not run OCaml at all (build.yml is Go-only) so this does not gate the merge.
7. **OCaml source tree is frozen.** Per the `git log --since='2026-04-11' -- src/ocaml/` query (zero commits since the refactor), the OCaml tree has been unmodified for ~5 weeks. The Go binary is the live runtime per README. The OCaml emitter remains the canonical schema authority — my contract change is correctly placed there — but its runtime emission path is not the live one. β should treat the OCaml change as schema source-of-truth, not as live-runtime verification.

### Voice / authority debt

8. **Skill activation index** — the new `agent/memory` skill will be picked up by `Cn_activation.build_index` automatically (it walks installed package skill dirs). Verified by inspection of `cn_activation.ml`'s walker logic; not exercised by a fresh-hub integration test in this cycle because doing so would require setting up a hub fixture with the cycle's own package installed. Risk: low — the activation path is well-trodden by existing skills.

The first four items are out-of-scope by design (scaffold + non-goals). Items 5–7 are adjacent findings α surfaced during the harness audit; item 5 was patched because the audit required it, items 6–7 were left because the scope of repair is larger than #100. Item 8 is a known integration-test gap.
