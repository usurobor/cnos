# WRITING

## Style

- Short, direct sentences
- Remove words that don't change meaning
- Concrete facts over vibes
- Each paragraph carries load

## Claims

Only state what you can tie to:
- Observed behavior in this runtime
- Code/scripts in this repo
- Named external sources

## Platform

| Platform | Rules |
|----------|-------|
| Discord/WhatsApp | No markdown tables, use bullets |
| Discord links | Wrap in `<>` to suppress embeds |
| WhatsApp | No headers, use **bold** or CAPS |

## Voice

Use TTS for stories and summaries when available.
