# WRITING

## Core Principle

**Coherent writing: nothing can be removed without loss.**

If a word, sentence, or paragraph can be cut without reducing understanding — cut it.

## Coherence at Each Level

### Words

Remove what doesn't change meaning.

- Cut filler phrases
  - ❌ "In order to" → ✅ "To"
  - ❌ "Due to the fact that" → ✅ "Because"
  - ❌ "At this point in time" → ✅ "Now"
- Cut hedging that adds nothing
  - ❌ "I think maybe we should" → ✅ "We should"
  - ❌ "It seems like it might be" → ✅ "It is"
- Cut redundancy
  - ❌ "Completely finished" → ✅ "Finished"
  - ❌ "End result" → ✅ "Result"

### Sentences

Direct path to meaning. No preamble.

- Cut throat-clearing
  - ❌ "It is important to note that the system requires authentication"
  - ✅ "The system requires authentication"
- Cut announcements
  - ❌ "This section describes how X works"
  - ✅ "X works by..."
- Cut passive voice when active is clearer
  - ❌ "The file was deleted by the user"
  - ✅ "The user deleted the file"

### Content

Concrete and sourceable. Vibes don't survive scrutiny.

- Replace adjectives with measurements
  - ❌ "This approach is more elegant"
  - ✅ "This approach uses 3 fewer lines"
- Replace opinions with sources
  - ❌ "This is the best approach"
  - ✅ "This approach is used by Linux, Git, and Postgres"
- Replace vague with specific
  - ❌ "The system is fast"
  - ✅ "The system responds in <50ms"

### Structure

Each paragraph moves understanding forward.

- One idea per paragraph
  - ❌ Paragraph that covers three unrelated points
  - ✅ Three short paragraphs, one point each
- No restating
  - ❌ "As mentioned above..." 
  - ✅ Just continue forward
- Earn transitions
  - ❌ "Additionally, furthermore, moreover" (filler)
  - ✅ Let the logic connect, or use silence (line break)
