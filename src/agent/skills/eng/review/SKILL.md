# Review

Review code so that every verdict traces to evidence in the diff and its surrounding contract.

## Core Principle

**Coherent review: every claim is verified against the diff, its required surrounding contract, and the relevant unchanged context — and no incoherence passes without being named.**

---

## 1. Define

### 1.1. Identify the parts

- Diff — what changed
- Context — unchanged code, named docs/specs, required branch artifacts, CI/release-gate state
- Verdict — approve or request changes
- Evidence — line, commit, artifact, or behavior that supports a claim
  - ❌ "This looks wrong"
  - ✅ "Line 42 stages all files, but git_stage validates per-file — compound behavior"

### 1.2. Articulate how they fit

- The diff proposes or modifies an invariant.
- Context must still cohere with that invariant.
- The verdict reflects the worst named incoherence.
- Evidence anchors every claim.
  - ❌ Review the diff in isolation
  - ✅ Review the diff, then check whether unchanged siblings now violate the invariant it establishes

### 1.3. Name the failure mode

Review fails via **surface reading** — checking only what changed, missing what the change implies for the rest of the system.

  - ❌ "All changed functions look correct"
  - ✅ "Three observe ops now use exclusions; the unchanged fourth one no longer matches the pattern"

---

## 2. Unfold

### 2.0. Issue — what was promised

**GATE: Complete §2.0 before reading the diff.** The review is structurally incomplete if these tables are absent.

```markdown
## §2.0 Issue Contract

### AC Coverage
| # | AC | In diff? | Status (met / partial / missing / deferred) |
|---|----|----------|---------------------------------------------|

### Named Doc Updates
| Doc / File | In diff? | Status (updated / absent / deferred) |
|------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
```

2.0.1. **Walk every acceptance criterion**
  - Each AC is either:
    - met
    - partially met
    - explicitly deferred
    - missing
  - The absence of a required change is a finding.
  - ❌ Review only what changed without checking what was promised
  - ✅ "AC 4 (cn doctor validates contract) — not addressed in diff, no known-debt note → D"

2.0.2. **Check required spec/doc updates**
  - If the issue requires a spec or design doc change, verify that file was changed.
  - If the issue or plan names specific docs, check each one.
  - Missing required doc/spec updates are β gaps between issue contract and implementation.
  - ❌ "Diff looks clean" (required spec update missing)
  - ✅ "Issue names 5 docs; 2 updated, 3 absent — are these deferred or forgotten?"

2.0.3. **Distinguish scope reduction from omission**
  - If scope was intentionally narrowed, the commit/PR should say so.
  - Unmentioned AC omissions are findings.
  - Noted deferrals are known debt.
  - ❌ Assume missing AC was intentionally deferred
  - ✅ "3 of 6 ACs met; remaining 3 not mentioned — are these deferred or forgotten?"

2.0.4. **AC strength — "met" means fully met**
  - If an AC says "validate X against Y" and the code only checks "X exists," that is partial, not met.
  - Partial ACs are findings.
  - ❌ "Doctor checks for the key → AC met"
  - ✅ "AC says validate against runtime state; code checks key presence only → partial"

2.0.5. **CDD artifact contract**
  - Determine the change class:
    - bugfix
    - substantial feature
    - governance/process
    - release hardening
  - Verify the required CDD artifacts for that class exist in the diff or branch. Suggested minimums:
    - substantial feature — design doc, coherence contract, implementation plan, tests, code, docs, self-coherence
    - bugfix — coherence contract (may live in issue/PR/commit body), tests, code, self-coherence if substantial
    - governance/process — self-coherence, frozen snapshot if versioned, plan if the branch formalizes process changes
    - release hardening — changelog, release artifacts, post-release assessment if method requires it
  - Missing required artifacts are findings.
  - ❌ "Diff looks clean" (governance branch has no self-coherence report)
  - ✅ "Substantial feature branch — design doc exists, self-coherence exists, bootstrap stubs present"

---

### 2.1. Diff — what changed

Read the diff for internal coherence.

2.1.1. **Check each change against its stated purpose**
  - Commit/PR says X, diff does Y.
  - ❌ "feat: add fs_glob" but glob still returns not_yet_implemented
  - ✅ "feat: add fs_glob" and executor path is complete

2.1.2. **Check changes against each other**
  - Multiple commits in a branch must tell one story.
  - ❌ Commit 3 silently undoes commit 1
  - ✅ Fix commits narrow the remaining blockers and reference what they fix

2.1.3. **Mechanical diff scan**
  - Before judgment checks, run mechanical scans on the diff itself:
    - Grep for duplicate entries in any list/array literal added or modified
    - Verify branch name matches project convention (e.g. CDD branch format)
    - If tests are in the diff, verify expect-test outputs are plausible (exact strings, whitespace)
  - These are deterministic — two reviewers running the same grep must find the same results.
  - ❌ Read the diff for logic only
  - ✅ "L74: `<invoke>` appears twice in `xml_prefixes` — duplicate entry"

---

### 2.2. Context — unchanged siblings

Check whether the change creates obligations on code it did not touch.

2.2.1. **Sibling consistency**
  - If you harden 3 of 4 peers at the same level, the 4th is now incoherent.
  - ❌ "All changed ops look good"
  - ✅ "Three observe ops use exclusions; git_status still doesn't"

2.2.1a. **Input-source enumeration for filters/sanitizers/validators**
  - When the diff adds or modifies a function that filters, sanitizes, or validates, enumerate every input source (caller/call site) that feeds it. Verify each input gets the full pipeline.
  - This is mandatory for security-relevant paths (sanitization, auth, access control).
  - ❌ "Body goes through the stripper — looks good"
  - ✅ "Body goes through strip_xml + strip_frontmatter. Reply goes through is_control_plane_like only. Reply is missing strip_xml — sibling gap."

2.2.2. **Cross-module leakage**
  - Follow what the changed code writes/produces and inspect what reads/exposes it.
  - ❌ Review executor in isolation
  - ✅ "Executor writes state/artifacts/; git_status now exposes those paths"

2.2.3. **Multi-format parity**
  - If a module renders to multiple formats (markdown + JSON, prompt + disk, human + machine), verify both carry equivalent semantic content.
  - ❌ Review render_markdown and to_json independently
  - ✅ "Markdown includes capabilities sub-block; JSON omits it"

2.2.4. **Exclusion symmetry**
  - If paths are excluded in one place, verify they are excluded everywhere they should be.
  - ❌ "Exclusions look correct in git_diff"
  - ✅ Grep every use of the exclusion set and verify parity

2.2.5. **Cross-reference validation (file moves)**
  - If files move or are renamed, grep for old paths across all live docs.
  - Any live stale path is a D-level blocker.
  - Frozen snapshot dirs may allow path-only repair if the docs system explicitly permits it.
  - ❌ Approve a file-move PR without grepping
  - ✅ Grep old path → zero live matches

2.2.6. **Execution timeline for state-changing paths**
  - If code crosses process or binary boundaries, trace which process owns which values at each step.
  - ❌ "This reads the version in process, so it's current"
  - ✅ "Old process still holds old constants after replacement; re-exec before reading"

2.2.7. **Derivation vs validation**
  - If an AC claims "single source of truth" or "one-file edit," verify that a generation step exists, not only a check.
  - ❌ "CI script checks VERSION parity → one-file bump met"
  - ✅ "No generation step exists; multiple manual edits still required"

2.2.8. **Authority-surface conflict**
  - When multiple surfaces claim to define the same thing, verify they agree. Common conflict sites:
    - canonical doc vs executable skill
    - runtime prompt-visible contract vs machine-readable JSON
    - issue ACs vs narrower coherence contract in PR body
    - branch summary vs actual branch state
    - runtime defaults vs documented defaults
  - ❌ "Skill looks correct" (didn't compare with canonical doc)
  - ✅ "Canonical doc and executable skill agree on artifact contract"

---

### 2.3. Verdict — the judgment

The verdict is a function of the worst named incoherence.

2.3.1. **Every claim traces to evidence**
  - No "seems wrong." Point to a line, commit, file, artifact, or runtime behavior.
  - ❌ "Security model seems weak"
  - ✅ "Line 277 passes user input to git grep without -e"

2.3.2. **Validate fixes against upstream spec where applicable**
  - If a fix relies on external behavior (Git, library, API), verify against upstream docs.
  - ❌ "The pathspec seems to work"
  - ✅ "Git docs confirm exclude-pathspec semantics"

2.3.3. **Name the severity**
  - D — blocker, demonstrable incoherence
  - C — significant incoherence, non-blocking
  - B — improvement opportunity
  - A — polish

2.3.4. **Specify regression pairs for blockers**
  - Every D-level finding includes:
    - positive case
    - negative case
  - ❌ "Fix git_status"
  - ✅ "Positive: show src/ changes. Negative: hide .cn/, state/, logs/."

2.3.5. **Close the search space on approval**
  - Approval explicitly states that no remaining blocker was found in the relevant contract.
  - ❌ "APPROVED"
  - ✅ "APPROVED — I do not see a remaining blocker in the executor/sandbox contract"

2.3.6. **Evidence depth matches claim strength**
  - When judging whether an AC is met, verify that the evidence depth matches the claim:
    - structural claim → unit/schema proof may suffice
    - runtime behavior claim → path/integration proof may be required
    - operator contract claim → output/projection/state artifact may be required
  - ❌ "Predicate tests exist → runtime filtering AC met"
  - ✅ "Predicate tests prove the predicate; no integration test proves the queue/offset path"

## 3. Rules

3.1. **Read the diff, then read the neighbors**
  - The diff is the figure; unchanged siblings are the ground.

3.2. **Trace system writes to system reads**
  - If changed code writes files/state, check what reads/exposes them.

3.3. **One round, one narrowing**
  - Each review round acknowledges fixes by commit hash and names only remaining blockers.

3.4. **Verdict before details**
  - Lead with APPROVED / REQUEST CHANGES.

3.5. **No phantom blockers**
  - Only block on incoherence you can demonstrate.

3.6. **Approve when coherent, not when perfect**
  - The bar is coherence, not taste.

3.7. **CI / release-gate state**
  - If merge is requested, verify required CI/build checks are complete and green.
  - If checks are missing, stale, or red, approval is provisional.
  - Do not issue an unconditional merge instruction when required checks have not run.

3.8. **Merge instruction is explicit and scoped**
  - Approval names the exact branch, PR number, and action.

## 5. Severity

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **D** | Incoherence demonstrable with a test or direct contradiction | REQUEST CHANGES |
| **C** | Real incoherence, non-blocking | APPROVED with note |
| **B** | Improvement opportunity | APPROVED |
| **A** | Polish | APPROVED |

### 5.1. Finding taxonomy

Every finding MUST be tagged as one of:

| Type | Definition | Examples |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **mechanical** | Could be caught by grep/diff/script without judgment | stale path, wrong branch name, snapshot mismatch, broken link |
| **judgment** | Requires design/coherence assessment | missing AC coverage, authority conflict, design trade-off |

Mechanical findings reaching review are **process bugs**. If mechanical findings exceed 20% of total findings in a release cycle, file a process issue.

## 6. Output Format

```markdown
**Verdict:** APPROVED / REQUEST CHANGES

**Round:** N (if multi-round)
**Fixed this round:** `<commit hashes>` closes `<prior findings>` (if applicable)

## 7. After Review

- **Approved:** Reviewer merges (or signals merge-ready per repo workflow), branch cleaned up
- **Changes requested:** Author fixes, re-requests; reviewer narrows on the next round

### 7.1. Review identity

The reviewer must have a different GitHub identity than the PR author so that:
- `gh pr review --request-changes` and `--approve` use native GitHub review state
- Branch protection can enforce "approving review from non-author"
- Review audit trail is platform-native, not comment-based

If the reviewer shares the author's GitHub account, reviews degrade to comments and review state is unenforceable. This is a known gap (tracked in #45 migration queue) — when it applies, note "posted as comment (shared identity)" in the review.
