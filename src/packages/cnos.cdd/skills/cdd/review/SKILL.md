# Review — Orchestrator

## Core Principle

A review is a witnessed judgment, not a rubber stamp. The reviewer owes the same honesty discipline as the implementer: name what is wrong, trace it to evidence, and state what must change.

```text
Review = tri(contract truth, implementation/projection evidence, witnessed verdict)
```

The review proceeds in three phases. **Each phase loads its own sub-skill.** Do not attempt all phases from memory — the sub-skills contain the detail.

---

## Phases

### Phase 1: Contract integrity

**Load:** `review/contract/SKILL.md`

Before reading the diff for implementation correctness, verify that the work contract (issue + PR body + branch summary) is internally consistent, truthful about status, and non-contradictory.

Complete the Contract Integrity table. If any row is "no," the review cannot approve unless the row is explicitly out of scope and the reviewer names why.

### Phase 2: Implementation review

**Load:** `review/implementation/SKILL.md`

Walk the issue contract (ACs, named docs, CDD artifacts). Read the diff and its neighbors. Apply mechanical scans, architecture checks, and evidence-bound findings.

> **Future split (deferred).** Phase 2 currently bundles three cognitive modes — issue-contract walk, diff/context inspection, and architecture/design check. When `review/implementation/SKILL.md` grows past the next size budget, split it into siblings `review/issue-contract/SKILL.md`, `review/diff-context/SKILL.md`, and `review/architecture/SKILL.md`, each owning one reason to change. The orchestrator's phase order does not change; only the load granularity does.

### Phase 3: Verdict

Return to this file for verdict rules and output format.

---

## Verdict Rules

3.1. **Every claim traces to evidence**
  - No "seems wrong." Point to a line, commit, file, artifact, or behavior.

3.2. **Name the severity**
  - D — blocker, demonstrable incoherence
  - C — significant incoherence, non-blocking
  - B — improvement opportunity
  - A — polish

3.3. **All findings must be resolved before merge**
  - There is no "approved with follow-up."
  - D findings block merge. C/B/A findings must be fixed on-branch before merge.
  - Only exception: finding requires a design decision outside issue scope → "deferred by design scope," author files issue before merge.

3.4. **Verdict before details**
  - Lead with APPROVED / REQUEST CHANGES.

3.5. **No phantom blockers**
  - Only block on incoherence you can demonstrate.

3.6. **Approve when coherent, not when perfect**
  - The bar is coherence, not taste.

3.7. **Close the search space on approval**
  - Approval explicitly states that no remaining blocker was found in the relevant contract.

3.8. **Evidence depth matches claim strength**
  - structural claim → unit/schema proof may suffice
  - runtime behavior claim → path/integration proof required
  - operator contract claim → output/projection/state artifact required

3.9. **Specify regression pairs for D-level findings**
  - Every D-level finding includes positive case + negative case.

3.10. **CI / release-gate state**
  - If merge is requested, verify required CI/build checks are green on branch head.
  - If checks are missing/stale/red, approval is provisional: "Do not merge until checks finish green."

3.11. **Merge instruction is explicit**
  - Names the exact branch and merge action with `Closes #N` in the merge commit.

3.12. **Review divergence is a skill gap**
  - When two reviewers diverge, the fix is a patch to the review skill, not "be more careful."

## Finding Taxonomy

| Type | Definition | Examples |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **mechanical** | Caught by grep/diff/script | stale path, wrong branch name, broken link |
| **judgment** | Requires design/coherence assessment | missing AC, authority conflict, design trade-off |
| **contract** | Work contract is incoherent | issue contradiction, PR overclaim, draft-as-current, exception contradicts hard gate, proof plan missing |

Contract findings may overlap with mechanical or judgment — tag both when applicable.

Mechanical findings reaching review are **process bugs**. If >20% of findings in a cycle are mechanical, file a process issue.

---

## Severity

| Sev | Meaning | Merge readiness |
|-----|---------|-----------------|
| D | Demonstrable incoherence | not merge-ready |
| C | Real incoherence, locally non-blocking | not merge-ready until fixed |
| B | Improvement opportunity | not merge-ready until fixed |
| A | Polish | not merge-ready until fixed |

---

## Output Format

Written to `.cdd/unreleased/{N}/beta-review.md`. Each round appends a new section.

```markdown
**Verdict:** APPROVED / REQUEST CHANGES

**Round:** N
**Fixed this round:** {commit hashes} closes {prior findings}
**Branch CI state:** green / provisional
**Merge instruction:** `git merge {branch}` into main with `Closes #{issue}`

## After Review

- **Approved:** β merges branch into main with `Closes #N`, pushes, proceeds to release per `release/SKILL.md`.
- **Changes requested:** α fixes on branch, appends to `self-coherence.md`; β narrows on next round.

### Review identity

β uses a different git identity than α — `beta@cdd.{project}` versus `alpha@cdd.{project}`. The role separation is git-observable.
