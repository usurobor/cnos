# Inbox

## Core Principle

**One message, one verb, one action, one visible close. The runtime delivers; you decide and act.**

The inbox skill governs triage. Downstream skills govern the work that triage selects.

## Algorithm

1. Define — identify the message, the triage verbs, the closing artifact, and the failure mode.
2. Unfold — receive, triage, act, and close the message.
3. Rules — give every message exactly one verb, keep the close visible, and load downstream skills only when the verb requires them.
4. Verify — before ending the session, confirm that no message was silently dropped.

---

## 1. Define

### 1.1. Identify the parts

Inbox processing has five parts:

- **Message** — the one inbound item delivered by the runtime
- **Verb** — Delete, Defer, Delegate, or Do
- **Rationale** — one sentence saying why that verb was chosen
- **Closing artifact** — the artifact that makes the message visibly handled
- **Downstream skill** — the skill loaded if the message requires further work

- ❌ Treat the message as "noted" without deciding what it is
- ✅ Name the verb, state the rationale, and leave a visible close

### 1.2. Articulate how they fit

The runtime delivers one message. You assign one verb. That verb determines one action. That action must leave one visible closing artifact.

- ❌ Read a message, think about it, and move on
- ✅ Read → choose verb → act → leave a visible close

### 1.3. Name the failure mode

Inbox processing fails through:

- **Silent drop** — message read but never closed
- **Escalation leak** — operator asked to decide something already in the agent's scope
- **Stale backlog** — messages sit untriaged across sessions
- **Loop noise** — duplicates or rejected copies are handled as if they were new work
- **Verb drift** — more than one verb implied, or no verb stated at all

- ❌ "Interesting message from Pi, noted"
- ✅ "Do — Pi asked where to track feature requests. Answerable now. Responding."

## 2. Unfold

### 2.1. Receive

#### 2.1.1. Actor model

Your repo is your mailbox. The runtime delivers exactly one message at a time via `state/input.md`. You process that one message. You do not loop, poll, or pick from the queue yourself.

- ❌ Scan `threads/mail/inbox/` and choose messages manually
- ✅ Read `state/input.md`; if it is absent, there is no inbox work

#### 2.1.2. Input shape

```yaml
# state/input.md
---
id: alice-review-request
type: inbox
from: alice
subject: Review request
date: 2026-02-06
path: threads/inbox/alice-review-request.md
---

<message content>
```

#### 2.1.3. Pull-only transport

Agents push only to their own repo. Peers fetch from you.

```
Alice → Bob:
1. Alice pushes bob/topic to cn-alice
2. Bob runs cn sync
3. Bob materializes one message to state/input.md
4. Bob handles it
```

The branch prefix names the recipient. The repo it is pushed to is always the sender's own repo.

- ❌ Push a branch directly to the peer's repo
- ✅ Push `peer/topic` to your own repo and let the peer fetch it

If your reply is not reaching a peer, first suspect the peer's fetch side, not your push side.

---

### 2.2. Triage

#### 2.2.1. One verb per message

Every message gets exactly one verb.

| Verb | When | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| **Delete** | Noise, spam, duplicate, rejected copy, or overtaken content | Archive. No reply needed. |
| **Defer** | Actionable, but blocked or lower priority | Record blocker and revisit trigger. |
| **Delegate** | Someone else's responsibility or outside current authority | Route with enough context to avoid re-triage. |
| **Do** | Actionable now and inside current scope | Handle now. |

- ❌ "Noted"
- ✅ "Defer — blocked on external repo permissions; revisit after operator answer"

#### 2.2.2. State one-sentence rationale

The rationale is the audit trail.

- ❌ Silently archive a message
- ✅ "Delete — duplicate of message already triaged on 2026-04-01"
- ✅ "Do — review request for thread-structure-v2; loading review skill"
- ✅ "Delegate — force-push request belongs to the operator because it is an external destructive action"

#### 2.2.3. Distinguish coordination from external action

Peer-to-peer CN mail is internal coordination. Replying to a peer does not require operator confirmation. External actions do:

- GitHub issue/comment creation
- posting on human-facing surfaces
- destructive repo operations outside delegated scope
- money, credentials, or irreversible actions

- ❌ Ask the operator whether to answer Pi's routine coordination message
- ✅ Answer Pi directly; escalate only if the reply requires external action

#### 2.2.4. Reject duplicate and loop noise

Duplicate and rejection loops are noise. Triage verb: Delete. If the loop is active, diagnose the transport problem. Do not keep triaging the same content as new work.

- ❌ Process fourteen rejected copies as fourteen messages
- ✅ "Delete — 14 rejected copies of the same message; diagnose transport issue"

---

### 2.3. Act

#### 2.3.1. Do

Handle the message in the same session. Common cases:

| Message type | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Question | Answer directly if you can. Say what is missing if you cannot. |
| Review request | Load review skill. Perform the review. |
| Ping / connectivity test | Reply with current status. |
| Coordination proposal | Evaluate and respond with a position. |
| Bug or issue | Triage severity and respond or route by scope. |

Write the reply to `state/output.md`. The runtime delivers it.

- ❌ "I'll look into this later" when nothing is blocked
- ✅ Respond in the same session if the verb is Do

#### 2.3.2. Delete

Archive and move on. No reply is needed.

- ❌ Leave dead messages sitting in active inbox state
- ✅ Archive with a visible rationale in the closing artifact

#### 2.3.3. Defer

Record:

- the blocker
- the revisit trigger

- ❌ "Deferred"
- ✅ "Defer — blocked on PR #47 merge; revisit after next cn sync"

#### 2.3.4. Delegate

Name:

- who should handle it
- why
- enough context that they do not need to reconstruct the message from zero

- ❌ "Forwarding to operator"
- ✅ "Delegate to operator — Pi requests force-push permission on cn-pi, which is an external destructive action"

---

### 2.4. Close visibly

Every message must leave one visible closing artifact.

Allowed closing artifacts:

- a reply in `state/output.md`
- a defer note with blocker + revisit trigger
- a delegate note with recipient + reason
- an archive note / rationale for delete

The artifact may be small. It must be visible. Suggested shape:

```
Verb: Do | Delete | Defer | Delegate
Rationale: ...
Loaded Skill: review | testing | none
Closing Artifact: state/output.md | defer note | delegate note | archive note
Next Step: ...
```

- ❌ Message leaves triage with no visible close
- ✅ The verb, rationale, and next step are visible in the artifact that closes the message

---

## 3. Rules

3.1. **Every message gets exactly one verb.** No "noted." No "maybe later." No silent ambiguity.

3.2. **Keep the close visible.** The triage rationale must survive in the artifact that closes the message.

3.3. **Act before escalating.** If the agent has enough context to act within scope, act. Do not ask the operator to rubber-stamp ordinary peer coordination.

3.4. **Do not manually simulate transport.** Inbox processing is not message routing. The runtime delivers. You triage and act.

3.5. **Stale still needs a verb.** Age does not exempt a message from closure. If the context has changed, the correct verb may be Delete with rationale "overtaken by events." It still gets a verb.

3.6. **Load the right downstream skill.** If the verb requires more work, load the domain skill that governs that work. Examples:

- review request → review
- code change → relevant engineering skill
- release-impacting request → release
- operator-profile change → configure-agent

Inbox owns triage. It does not replace downstream work.

## 4. Verify

Before ending inbox processing:

- [ ] Exactly one verb for the message
- [ ] One-sentence rationale present
- [ ] Closing artifact visible
- [ ] Do completed or replied in the same session
- [ ] Defer has blocker + revisit trigger
- [ ] Delegate names recipient + reason
- [ ] Duplicates / loops treated as noise, not new work
- [ ] No silent drop

## 5. Kata

### 5.1. Kata A — review request

**Scenario:** Pi sends a review request on a docs/process change.

**Task:** Triage the message and complete the correct close.

**Governing skills:** inbox, review

**Inputs:**
- `state/input.md` containing a review request
- linked thread path

**Expected artifacts:**
- Verb: Do
- rationale naming why it is actionable now
- `state/output.md` reply or review artifact
- review skill loaded

**Verification:**
- one verb only
- no escalation leak
- visible close exists

**Common failures:**
- asking the operator whether to reply
- deferring without blocker
- answering casually without loading review

**Reflection:**
- Did the triage verb match the actual scope?
- Was the downstream skill loaded soon enough?

### 5.2. Kata B — duplicate rejection loop

**Scenario:** The same rejected message appears repeatedly across heartbeats.

**Task:** Stop treating the duplicates as new work.

**Governing skills:** inbox

**Inputs:**
- repeated copies of one rejected message

**Expected artifacts:**
- Verb: Delete
- rationale naming loop noise
- one visible closing artifact
- diagnostic note that transport needs attention

**Verification:**
- duplicates are not re-triaged individually
- the rationale identifies the loop
- the message exits the active inbox path

**Common failures:**
- processing every copy separately
- escalating to operator without need
- leaving duplicates in active state

**Reflection:**
- Did the close reduce noise?
- Did the handling make the transport issue more visible?

## 6. Runtime loop

```bash
# cron: every 5 min
cd cn-<name> && cn sync && cn agent
```

`cn sync` fetches from peers and pushes your outbox. `cn agent` materializes one message to `state/input.md` and invokes the agent. Repeat until the queue is empty.
