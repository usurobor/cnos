# cnos Changelog

## Release Coherence Ledger

Each release is scored on two dimensions: **coherence quality** (TSC grades) and **architectural scope** (engineering level).

**TSC grades** use the [TSC](https://github.com/usurobor/tsc) triadic axes, applied as intuition-level letter grades (A+ to F) per the [CLP self-check](https://github.com/usurobor/tsc-practice/tree/main/clp):

- **C_Σ** — Aggregate coherence: `(s_α · s_β · s_γ)^(1/3)`. Do the three axes describe the same system?
- **α (PATTERN)** — Structural consistency and internal logic. Does repeated sampling yield stable structure?
- **β (RELATION)** — Alignment between pattern, relations, and process. Do the parts fit together?
- **γ (EXIT/PROCESS)** — Evolution stability and procedural explicitness. Does the system change consistently?

These are intuition-level ratings, not outputs from a running TSC engine (formal C_Σ ranges 0–1; ≥0.80 = PASS).

**Engineering level** per [ENGINEERING-LEVELS.md](docs/gamma/ENGINEERING-LEVELS.md), capped by CDD §9.1 cycle execution quality:

- **L4** — Pre-architecture: working prototype, no stable boundaries yet
- **L5** — Local correctness: fix works, follows patterns, no boundary change
- **L6** — System-safe: cross-surface coherence, failure modes handled
- **L7** — System-shaping: architecture boundary moved, class of future work eliminated

See [RELEASE-LEVEL-CLASSIFICATION.md](docs/gamma/essays/RELEASE-LEVEL-CLASSIFICATION.md) for the full historical analysis.

| Version | C_Σ | α | β | γ | Rounds | Level | Coherence note |
|---------|-----|---|---|---|--------|-------|----------------|
| #345 (docs) | A | A | A | A | 1 | — | **Document the generic α/β/γ/δ/ε role-scope ladder as a cnos-level pattern** (#345, merge `9513362a`, docs-only §2.5b). `ROLES.md` at repo root (319L, §§1–8): 5-row role table with canonical verbs (produces/reviews/coordinates/operates/iterates), Bateson/von Foerster ambient prior art with honest-caveat, 6 instantiation fields, cdw as planned-not-shipped (§5 ≤200 words). `epsilon/SKILL.md` stub (64L) gives ε a canonical cdd-side home — cross-references `ROLES.md §1` row 5 and `post-release/SKILL.md` Step 5.6b. `CDD.md` blockquote pointer (6 lines, top of file) disclaims cdd-origin. `post-release/SKILL.md §5.6b` re-attributed to ε: cdd-iteration.md is ε's work product. AC5 self-application: close-out demonstrates attribution rule operational via empty-cycle clause (zero `cdd-*-gap` findings → no file → signal stays high). 1 review round, R1 APPROVED, 0 findings, 4 non-actionable observations. α A (6 ACs met first pass, oracle-grounded self-coherence, AC5 correctly deferred). β A (zero findings, observations precisely categorized, pre-merge gate complete). γ A (design-pre-converged issue pack, AC5 conditional structure correct, empty-cycle clause applied). |
| #342 (docs) | A | A | A | A | 1 | — | **Add `operator/SKILL.md §5` dispatch configurations + `release/SKILL.md §3.8` floor** (#342, merge `5e1414b9`, docs-only §2.5b). Names two valid dispatch configurations: §5.1 (canonical multi-session `claude -p`, full γ/δ separation) and §5.2 (single-session δ-as-γ via Agent tool, γ/δ collapse). §5.2 names three structural consequences: δ=γ collapse, sub-agent returns as summaries with artifact-canonical verification, branch-name churn under harness push restrictions. §5.3 lists ≥4 concrete escalation criteria back to §5.1. Amends `release/SKILL.md §3.8` with A− γ-floor clause for §5.2 cycles. Empirical anchors: cnos-tsc supercycle (cycles 24–26, `usurobor/tsc`) and tsc cycle #32 five-link branch trail. 1 review round, R1 APPROVED, 0 findings. Dispatch configuration: §5.1 (canonical multi-session, A− floor does not apply). α A (all 5 ACs met first pass, incremental commit discipline held, AC6 disclosed as post-merge debt). β A (single-round approval, zero findings, N1 observation documented below coherence bar). γ A (§5.1 cycle, full γ/δ separation; 1 round; AC6 recursive coherence declared post-merge). |
| #343 (docs) | A | A | A | A | 1 | — | **Canonical git identity convention for CDD role actors (`{role}@{project}.cdd.cnos`)** (#343, merge `dab628b1`, docs-only §2.5b). Prescribes `{role}@{project}.cdd.cnos` as canonical email for all CDD role actors; cnos project uses elision form `{role}@cdd.cnos` (avoids redundant `{role}@cnos.cdd.cnos`). Deprecates `{role}@cdd.{project}` (cycle #287 form). Migration note in `post-release/SKILL.md`; cross-references updated across `CDD.md`, `review/SKILL.md`, `alpha/SKILL.md`, `operator/SKILL.md`. Self-application: cycle ran under the new convention (commit trailers `alpha@cdd.cnos`, `beta@cdd.cnos`). 1 review round, R1 APPROVED, 0 findings. α A, β A, γ A. |
| #339 (docs) | A- | A- | A- | A- | 1 | — | **Mechanical pre-merge closure-gate enforcement + §3.8 rubric amendment** (#339, merge `544a0843`, docs-only §2.5b). Extends `scripts/validate-release-gate.sh` with `--mode pre-merge` (AC1): validates `alpha-closeout.md`, `beta-closeout.md`, `gamma-closeout.md` for each triadic cycle dir; diagnostic names cycle + filename; exit 1 blocks merge. Amends `release/SKILL.md` §3.8 (AC2): closure-gate-failure override forces `C_Σ` to `<C` before geometric-mean computation; `<C` / `C−` declared explicitly equivalent. Closes F2 (cdd-tooling-gap) + F7 (cdd-protocol-gap) from cycle #335. 1 review round, R1 APPROVED, no RC. Gate bootstrapping gap (O1): first-activation cycle passes vacuously — inherent design constraint, documented. α A- (clean implementation, both ACs met first pass). β A- (worktree gate verification, precise O1/O3 documentation). γ A- (recursive coherence made explicit in AC4 oracle). |
| #334 (docs) | C+ | A- | D | C | 0 | — | **Cycle scope sizing — split-decision heuristic + master+subs pattern** (#334, PR #336). +62 lines to `cdd/issue/SKILL.md`. AC-count bands, five-factor heuristic, master+subs pattern, empirical anchor from `tsc#23`. No β review. Retroactively closed. |
| #333 (docs) | C− | B | D | D | 0 | — | **TSC #23 upstream patches — pre-review gates, stream-json required, re-dispatch complexity** (#330, PR #333). 3 patches, +10/−5. α §2.6 rows 11–13 (artifact enumeration, caller-path trace, test assertion count), operator stream-json required, CDD §1.6b re-dispatch complexity. No β review. No close-out artifacts. Retroactively remediated by #335. |
| #331 (docs) | C− | B | D | D | 0 | — | **CDD supercycle learnings — 6 patches from TSC cross-repo bundle** (#331, PR #332). +202/−11. Honest-claim verification (§3.13), mode declaration + MCA preconditions, docs-only disconnect (§2.5b), review-rounds + finding-class metrics, honest-grading rubric (§3.8), cdd-iteration.md canonical home (Step 5.6b). Source: `usurobor/tsc` branch `courier/cnos-cdd-supercycle`. No β review. No close-out artifacts. Retroactively remediated by #335. |
| 3.65.0 | A- | A- | A- | A- | L5 | **`eng/troubleshoot`: live diagnosis skill for environmental and runtime failures** (#309). Adds `src/packages/cnos.eng/skills/eng/troubleshoot/SKILL.md` — structured triage for active process, OOM, tool-error, resource-pressure, and lifecycle failures mid-task. Gap evidence: 2026-04-30 identity-rotation dispatch test produced five β dispatch failures across three root-cause classes, each diagnosed ad-hoc with wrong first hypothesis. **Skill shape (9 ACs):** (AC1) classified as skill not runbook — teaches judgment (which step first) rather than platform commands; domain-specific coherence formula; named failure mode "premature hypothesis." (AC2) five Tier 3 skills loaded before drafting: skill, write, design, test, rca. (AC3) four external practices adapted into cnos form — IBM problem-description field set (§2.2: What/Where/When/Conditions/Reproducibility/Error messages/Effect/Environment), Google SRE hypothesis-driven process (§2.4), Red Hat one-change/retest discipline (§2.4, §2.6), CompTIA identify/theory/test/plan/implement-escalate/verify/document sequence (§2.3). (AC4) eleven-step triage algorithm mapped to six evidence classes in order: process state → kernel/OOM → tool output → resource pressure → lifecycle/parent → application/model; do not skip forward without testing each class. (AC5) hypothesis discipline explicit: state hypothesis before test, state oracle before test, run cheapest discriminating test, record negative result, make one change, verify against original symptom. (AC6) three worked examples from dispatch test: OOM kill (wrong hypothesis: token limit → dmesg → kernel OOM-killed; MCA: add 2GB swap), `gh` GraphQL error (wrong hypothesis: rate limit → tool_result error message → deprecated GraphQL field; MCA: `--json` flag), background-process kill (wrong hypothesis: rate limit → lifecycle check → parent shell ended; MCA: foreground only). (AC7) five RCA handoff triggers defined in §2.7; §3.7 prohibits starting RCA during live diagnosis. (AC8) embedded kata with OOM scenario: symptoms → wrong hypothesis (token limit) → triage path → root cause → MCA → verification → common failures → reflection. (AC9) frontmatter manually validated against `schemas/skill.cue` (cue CLI not installed on host — exit 2 = prerequisite missing, not schema failure; all hard-gate and spec-required-exception-backed fields present). **Cycle shape:** 1 review round, 0 findings. No §9.1 triggers fired. α A- (clean execution, all 9 ACs met first pass, debt disclosed honestly, single new file no boundary change). β A- (systematic AC walk, pre-merge gate executed, non-destructive merge test confirmed zero conflicts and exit-2 validator behavior). γ A- (issue dispatch high-quality: 9 ACs with evidence + external sources listed + model skills named + worked examples provided). |
| 3.64.0 | B+ | B+ | A- | B+ | L5 | **CDD merge/release authority separation, README v4 rewrite, #307 kata move.** Spec: β is "Reviewer + Integrator" (merge into main, no δ required); δ owns release boundary (preflight, tag, deploy, disconnect); new Phase 5a (δ release-boundary preflight). Docs: README rewritten for v4 convergence (thesis-first, layers diagram, coherent agents, honest shipped/not-shipped). #307 (P3): issue katas moved to `cnos.cdd.kata/katas/M5-issue-authoring/`. First live identity-rotation dispatch test: γ=OpenClaw/Sigma, α=Opus via `claude -p`, β=Sonnet via `claude -p`. 10 implementation findings recorded. L5: correct implementation, clean review (2 rounds), no system-level boundary change. |
| 3.63.0 | A- | A- | A- | A- | L6 (cycle cap: L6) | **CUE-based SKILL.md frontmatter validation in coherence CI (I5)** (#301, merged at `b483f36`). Adds a machine-checkable contract for SKILL.md frontmatter as a new CI gate (`skill-frontmatter-check`, ID I5) on every push and pull request. Pre-#301 the CTB v0.1 LANGUAGE-SPEC declared ten well-formedness constraints (§10) and reserved a fixed vocabulary (§11), but no CI job checked either; a spot survey at issue-filing time showed 30+ of 54 SKILL.md files missing fields the spec calls required. **L6 move:** machine-enforces the contract going forward and prevents continued frontmatter drift; not L7 because the gate catches drift at CI time rather than eliminating its source. **3 authority surfaces added with strict separation:** `schemas/skill.cue` owns shape / type / enum (CUE schema, `cue-lang/setup-cue@v1.0.1` action pinned + CUE `v0.13.2` pinned; field stratification — hard-gate `name`/`description`/`governing_question`/`triggers`/`scope` unconditional, spec-required-but-exception-backed `artifact_class`/`kata_surface`/`inputs`/`outputs` optional with script enforcement, optional-with-default `visibility`, reserved `requires`/`calls`/`calls_dynamic`/`runs_after`/`runs_before`/`excludes` validated only if present, open struct so unknown package-local keys like `parent:` pass per LANGUAGE-SPEC §11); `tools/validate-skill-frontmatter.sh` owns file discovery / frontmatter extraction / exception-list handling / `calls` filesystem-existence checks (`set -euo pipefail`, fail-fast `cue`/`jq`/`awk`/`find` prereq with exit code 2 distinct from validation-failure exit code 1, deterministic `find … \| sort`, NO_COLOR + non-TTY honored, machine-readable diagnostics one-per-line `path :: field :: rule :: reason :: fix`, `--self-test` / `--root` / `--file` / `--help` modes; `package_skill_root_of` resolver computes calls-base as the common ancestor of every SKILL.md in the package's `skills/` subtree per LANGUAGE-SPEC §2.4.1 example); `schemas/skill-exceptions.json` owns the debt ledger (43 field-specific entries each carrying `reason` and `spec_ref`; hard-gate fields cannot be excepted, only spec-required-but-exception-backed). **Negative proof via fixtures + `--self-test`:** `schemas/fixtures/skill-frontmatter/{valid,invalid}/` carries 3 positive (minimal hard-gate-only, full with every reserved field + unknown `parent:` key + sub-skill calls target, sub) and 4 negative cases each with `.expect` sidecar (missing-hard-gate, bad-enum-scope, broken-calls-target, missing-required-no-exception); CI runs both `--self-test` and full validation on every push. **`schemas/README.md`** documents what is/isn't validated, surface boundary, field stratification, exception mechanics, shrink procedure, local-run, CI integration, schema-update procedure. **46 SKILL.md frontmatter backfills** under `src/packages/**`: most add hard-gate fields where missing (the minimum to keep CI green); 2 are YAML strict-quoting normalizations (`cdd/design/SKILL.md`, `cdd/gamma/SKILL.md` for unquoted-colon-space sequences PyYAML accepts but CUE rejects); `cdd/release/SKILL.md` removes a stale cross-package `calls: -writing` entry (intra-package-only resolution per LANGUAGE-SPEC §2.4.1; the prior `writing` skill was renamed to `write` in an earlier cycle) and renames two prose references on the same lines from `writing` to `write` per β R1 F1. **Cycle shape:** 2 review rounds + 1 re-evaluation pass. R1 = 3 findings (F1 C-judgment `release/SKILL.md` L103 + L217 prose still referencing the renamed `writing` skill — α touched the file but left two prose surfaces stale; F2 A-mechanical numeric drift "45 entries" → actual 43 in self-coherence.md three sites; F3 A-mechanical recursive readiness-signal head-SHA convention — naming the readiness-commit's own SHA self-stales each refresh). No D-level findings. R2 = 0 findings (all three fixed in α commit `171188e` + appendix `55642db`; F3 convention changed to name the implementation-commit SHA, breaking the recursion). R2 Pass 2 = re-evaluation against fresh `origin/main` after cycle #287 (3.62.0) shipped during the review window — per the new `beta/SKILL.md` Role Rule 1 from #287, β re-fetches `origin/main` synchronously before each review pass; β had not done this for R1/R2 because the rule landed on `main` mid-cycle. Auto-merge against fresh main is conflict-free (one auto-merge on `cdd/gamma/SKILL.md`, disjoint regions); validator green on the merge tree (56/56 SKILL.md, all fixtures behave). All R1 findings stable under fresh base (content-level, immune to base advance — contrast cycle #287 R1 F1+F2 which were scope-drift findings against a stale spec and did collapse on fresh main). APPROVAL stands. **Doctrine update during the wait window:** σ pushed `4a0f678` "merge is β authority, not δ — δ owns release gates (tag/deploy) only" between β's R2 Pass 2 push and the merge; β read this as the operator's signal to proceed with the merge under the clarified doctrine. **§9.1 trigger fired:** "loaded skill failed to prevent a finding" — β's load-time canonical CDD/beta skills were a snapshot from session start; cycle #287's `beta/SKILL.md` re-fetch rule shipped on main mid-cycle and was not auto-loaded. β surfaced this in close-out as O1 (β-side stale-`origin/main` blind spot, re-discovered) and O2 (β skill load happens at session start; in-flight spec changes are not auto-loaded). Same root family as #287's β-side stale-`origin/main` cycle and #283's `git fetch --quiet` reliability gap; surface-distinct: this cycle's gap is canonical-skill snapshot drift across a release boundary, not polling-source drift. No false-positive findings resulted (R1 findings were content-level). **Scoring.** α A- (clean implementation across 9 ACs; 3 R1 findings closed in 2 commits; F3's recursive-SHA convention surfaced and fixed structurally; peer enumeration covered Class A schema-bearing surfaces and Class B CI-job peers; pre-implementation frontmatter delimiter survey across all 56 SKILL.md before assuming a delimiter-only-line extractor would work; 4-language polyglot re-audit YAML/CUE/Bash/JSON/Markdown post-patch). β A- (3 findings filed at correct severity with scope-narrowed in-touched-file disposition for F1; ran the cycle's own validator locally on the merge tree as a non-destructive merge test before executing the actual merge — pattern not yet named in `release/SKILL.md`; missed re-fetching `origin/main` per the cycle #287 rule until R2 Pass 2 because the rule landed mid-cycle on main; surfaced the discipline gap as O1 factual observation per voice rule). γ A- (issue dispatch high-quality with stratified ACs and named Tier 3 skills; 2 pre-dispatch correctness-fix issue-body comments tightened AC4/AC6/AC1 stratification; no γ-clarification needed during the cycle; one cycle-level absence: γ did not surface the `beta/SKILL.md` rule change to β when 3.62.0 shipped on main mid-cycle, leaving β to discover the new rule via its own re-fetch — γ-axis structural rather than dispatch failure). **Diff level L6** (machine-checkable contract added across the I5 surface; cross-surface coherence — schema/script/CI/exception ledger/README/fixtures all aligned; failure modes handled — exit codes 0/1/2 distinct, fixtures cover every diagnostic class). **Cycle cap L6** (no §9.1 trigger fired beyond the structural β-side discipline gap surfaced in O1/O2; the gap was caught by re-running the affected checks against new state and produced no false-positive findings; cycle execution was clean). Invariants: dyad-plus-coordinator preserved (β owned review → merge → release → close-out under sigma's clarified doctrine; γ will own the PRA); cycle-branch-as-canonical-coordination-surface preserved (legacy branch shape `claude/cnos-alpha-tier3-skills-MuE2P` because cycle predated the new `cycle/{N}` convention shipped in #287); β refused harness pre-provisioned per-role branch (`claude/implement-beta-skill-loading-BfBkH`) at intake per `beta/SKILL.md` §1 Role Rule 1; merge under β authority per σ's `4a0f678` clarification (no δ authorization required for the merge step; CI green precondition verified locally on the merge tree). **Bundled with #301:** σ's `4a0f678` doctrine clarification (merge authority lives with β, not δ); the cycle exemplifies the clarified contract by execution. |
| 3.62.0 | A- | A- | A- | A- | L6 (diff: L7; cycle cap: L6) | **γ creates the cycle branch — α and β only check out `cycle/{N}`** (#287, merged at `a5d0f21`). Branch creation moves from α to γ; canonical branch name is `cycle/{N}` (one cycle = one branch = one named target for all polling); legacy `{agent}/{slug}-{rand}` and `{agent}/{version}-{issue}-{scope}` shapes are warn-only. **L7 move:** eliminates the branch-glob discovery friction class — pre-#287 γ + β had to glob-match `'origin/claude/*'` to discover α's harness-encoded branch and the glob silently failed when scope-words replaced issue numbers (#274 / #283 R1 F1 derivation chain). Post-#287, polling targets `origin/cycle/{N}` directly with no glob; dispatch prompts name the branch in a `Branch:` line; α/β refuse harness pre-provisioned per-role branches. **5 spec files modified:** `CDD.md` (Role table; §Tracking polling-query table + new `git fetch --quiet` reliability dependency with N=10 re-probe rule per AC8; §1.4 γ Phase 1 step 3a + α step 5a + β step 3 single-named-branch poll + dispatch-prompt-format `Branch:` line; §4.1 row 2 + §4.2 + §4.3 branch rule and pre-flight ownership shifts to γ; §5.3 row 2); `gamma/SKILL.md` (§2.5 split into Step 3a + Step 3b; ## Step map row added); `alpha/SKILL.md` (§2.1 step 2 inserted check-out / never-create / refuse-harness-branch; §2.6 row 1 verifies-rebased; §2.7 push target named `origin/cycle/{N}`); `beta/SKILL.md` (§1 Role Rule 1 expanded — never-creates + refuses-harness-pre-provisioned + 4 ❌/4 ✅ examples); `operator/SKILL.md` (§2.2 polling snippet — canonical glob `origin/cycle/*`; legacy `origin/claude/*` warn-only). **Self-application (AC 12):** γ created `origin/cycle/287` from `origin/main` *before* α dispatch; α `git switch`ed onto it from harness branch `claude/alpha-cdd-skill-1aZnw`; β `git switch`ed from `claude/cnos-skill-module-x9jTE` and committed all verdicts on `cycle/287`; γ-clarification, β R1+R2+R3, α R1+R2 fix-round all landed on the single named branch — first cycle to exemplify the new contract by execution. **Cycle shape:** 3 review rounds. R1 = 4 findings (F1 D-contract, F2 C-contract, F3 C-contract, F4 A-judgment); F1+F2 were β-side stale-`origin/main` artifacts (β's `Monitor` polling watches `origin/cycle/{N}` only and never re-fetches `main`; σ's `70ff2b1` push to main happened between α dispatch and β R1 review and produced no wake-up event on the watched surface). γ-clarification at `c91cf87` captured the mechanical fact via synchronous `git fetch --verbose origin main` and surfaced that `70ff2b1` is on main, not on cycle/287. R2 = F1+F2 withdrawn; F3+F4 stand. α R2 fix-round chose β R2 path (a) — retroactive `git rebase -i {merge-base} --exec 'git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit'` + `git push --force-with-lease` — so all 5 α commits land with canonical `alpha@cdd.cnos`; F4 polish landed in `de32200`. R3 = APPROVED. **§9.1 trigger fired:** review rounds = 3 > 2 (root cause: β-side stale-`origin/main` blind spot — same class as #283's polling silent-failure observation but surface-distinct: #283 was transport-flake on the cycle branch, #287 is the polling-source-not-the-review-base mismatch). **MCA candidates (β factual observations, γ disposition pending):** `beta/SKILL.md` (or `review/SKILL.md`) gains a synchronous `git fetch --verbose origin main` rule before computing the review-diff base; α pre-review gate gains an identity-truth row checking `git config user.email` against `{role}@cdd.{project}`; force-push as a contract-finding repair pattern documented at the role-skill level. **Bundled with #287:** σ's `70ff2b1` incremental-write discipline for α self-coherence and β review (operator-authority spec change duplicating `CDD.md` §1.4 large-file authoring rule into role-skill surfaces; followed prospectively from α R1 forward — α split self-coherence.md into 6 incremental commits per σ's rule, β split beta-review.md R1 into 3 passes); #304 v2 issue packs + contract-integrity review split (review/SKILL.md restructured into Phase 1 contract integrity + Phase 2 implementation review + verdict sub-skills); #299 README realign + #302 lychee progressive ignore + #289 AC1/AC2 ctb docs (#290/#291) + #288 triadic agent-composition harvest tail; CI workflow consolidation (release-smoke into release.yml, ci.yml renamed build-verify.yml, kata jobs renamed binary-verify/package-verify); 3df97ba + 7533978 γ iteration proposal commits filing #292–#296. **Scoring.** α A- (12/12 AC evidence rows comprehensive in R1 draft; F3 identity drift caught by β was a session-start config error, fixed cleanly via path (a); F4 polish addressed; peer enumeration exhaustive across role-skill + lifecycle-skill + intra-doc classes). β A- (the diff-content review was clean — 12/12 ACs verified end-to-end at R1, no real diff drift; F1+F2 false-positives extended the round count by one due to β-side stale local `origin/main`, attributable to β-side polling-discipline gap not to α's diff; β-self-observation surfaced as factual observation per voice rule). γ A- (γ-clarification was timely, mechanical-environment-shaped via synchronous `git rev-parse origin/main` capture, and resolved F1+F2 in one β-side re-fetch + R2 withdrawal without adjudicating β's review reasoning or authoring α's response; γ refused harness per-role γ branch and committed all γ artifacts on `cycle/287` per `CDD.md` §Tracking auth precondition; no γ-side process drift this cycle; the β-side polling-discipline gap is structural and patched as immediate MCA in 3.62.0 PRA §6.1, not a γ-axis cycle-economics regression — γ holds A- equal to baseline). **Diff level L7** (eliminates the branch-glob discovery friction class for all future cycles; single named-target polling collapses 4 query forms to 1; γ-owned branch creation removes α's "invent a name" step entirely). **Cycle cap L6** (one §9.1 trigger fired — review rounds = 3; root-cause analysis complete in close-outs; β-side review-base re-fetch gap is structurally similar to #283's `git fetch --quiet` reliability observation, both belong to the "polling-source-vs-truth-source" friction family). Invariants: dyad-plus-coordinator preserved (β owns review→merge→release→close-out; γ owns clarification + PRA); cycle-branch-as-canonical-coordination-surface (#283) tightened — branch name now canonical and γ-owned, removing the last source of glob/discovery friction; AC 12 self-application confirms the new contract is enforceable by inspection. |
| 3.61.1 | — | — | — | — | — (patch) | **δ post-cycle disconnect for 3.61.0.** Tag 3.61.0 pushed (β deferred due to HTTP 403). Release CI green, GitHub release published with full asset set. Merged remote branches swept: `claude/cdd-tier-1-skills-pptds`, `claude/implement-beta-skill-loading-ZXWKe` (γ session branch `claude/gamma-skill-issue-283-nuiUZ` already deleted). Post-cycle content: γ PRA (11 commits: measurement, lag, process learning, finding triage, cycle iteration, CHANGELOG row, α close-out addendum, γ close-out, closure declaration); #288 triadic agent-composition harvest (SEMANTICS-NOTES §15 tri()-as-carrier, LANGUAGE-SPEC v0.2 §1.4 triadic carrier + §6.4/6.5 operator obligations/dimensions + §11 reserved vocabulary + §13 worked example, README document-map update, Vision §13 agent-turn addendum). |
| 3.61.0 | A- | A- | A | A- | L5 (diff: L7; cycle cap: L5) | **Replace GitHub PR workflow with `.cdd/unreleased/{N}/` artifact exchange in CDD** (#283, merged at `58c1666`). Triadic coordination shifts from PR-mediated to artifact-driven: α writes `.cdd/unreleased/{N}/self-coherence.md` (review-readiness signal, AC mapping, fix-rounds) on the cycle branch; β writes `beta-review.md` (round-by-round verdicts) to the same branch; γ writes `gamma-clarification.md` and `gamma-closeout.md` to the same branch; the cycle branch is the canonical coordination surface during in-version work. Issues remain (gap-naming); branches remain (isolation); **PRs are removed from the triadic protocol**. **L7 move:** eliminates the PR-polling friction class — every prior cycle paid a PR-existence/PR-status/PR-comments quadruple-poll that silently degraded under shared GitHub identity, missing branch-globs, or unreliable `head=`/`closes:#` filters (#274 / #268 / #266 derivation chain). The new model uses one polling channel (per-branch head-SHA tracking with `git ls-tree -r origin/{branch}` dereference on transition) for two surfaces (branch + cycle dir). **9 skill files modified:** `CDD.md` (§Tracking rewritten end-to-end; §1.4 α/β/γ algorithms; §5.3 step rows 4/5/7/7a/8/9; §5.3a Artifact Location Matrix with new canonical close-out paths and warn-only legacy aggregates; §5.4 CDD Trace template); `alpha/SKILL.md` (§2.5/§2.6/§2.7 — PR-creation override clause removed per AC8; §2.8 close-out split from self-coherence); `beta/SKILL.md` (frontmatter inputs/outputs; §1 phase map; §5 closure → `beta-closeout.md`); `gamma/SKILL.md` (frontmatter inputs; §2.5 polling snippet; §2.7 close-out triage paths); `review/SKILL.md` (§2.0 PRE-GATE replaces `gh pr view` with `git merge-base --is-ancestor`; §6 output → `beta-review.md`; §7 `git merge` not `gh pr merge`; §7.1 review identity = git author identity); `release/SKILL.md` (§2.5a per-cycle dir move; §2.10 β close-out → `beta-closeout.md`); `post-release/SKILL.md` (§3 lag-table key; §5.5 review quality reads `beta-review.md` rounds; pre-publish gate); `operator/SKILL.md` (§2.1/§2.2 wake-up signals + polling snippet; §3.1 gate table; §6 lifecycle table); top-level `cdd/SKILL.md` frontmatter `triggers` drops `PR`. **6 legacy file migrations** (rename-only, content preserved): `.cdd/unreleased/{alpha,beta,gamma}/{268,278}.md` → `.cdd/unreleased/{268,278}/{alpha,beta,gamma}-closeout.md`. **Cycle shape:** 2 review rounds (target ≤ 2). R1 = 4 findings (F1 D-judgment polling-source incoherence across 5 surfaces — `CDD.md` §Tracking polled `origin/main` while α's `self-coherence.md` lived only on the branch; cycle did not exemplify its own rule; F2 C-judgment `release/SKILL.md` §2.10 placed β close-out in `beta-review.md`, contradicting 5 peer surfaces; F3 C-judgment `post-release/SKILL.md` pre-publish gate required legacy `gamma/CLOSE-OUT.md`; F4 B-judgment `post-release/SKILL.md` §5.6 referenced superseded `{role}.md` placeholder shape). γ-clarification (`2f83095`) resolved F1 to candidate (a) "branch-polling canonical, one cycle branch holds all role artifacts" before α's fix-round. R2 = 0 findings. **Mechanical ratio 0%** (all judgment); below §9.1 process-issue threshold. **Self-application:** α chose option 1 — the cycle exemplifies its own new rule. β's R1 verdict cherry-picked from β-side branch (`claude/implement-beta-skill-loading-ZXWKe@1ceb99c`) onto α's cycle branch as `8d78514`, preserving git authorship (`author: beta`, `committer: alpha`); R2 verdict committed directly to α's cycle branch (`209882b`). Merged head `58c1666` carries `gamma-clarification.md`, `beta-review.md` (R1+R2), `self-coherence.md` (R1 + R2 fix-round appendix), and the 9-file skill diff in one merge commit. **§9.1 triggers fired:** "loaded skill failed to prevent a finding" — α's own re-audit (`alpha/SKILL.md` §2.6 row 9) did not catch F1 (the new spec self-contradicted on polling source) or F4 (`{role}.md` drift in `post-release/SKILL.md` §5.6 missed during the mid-cycle pivot from `{N}/{role}.md` to descriptive filenames); review rounds = 2 (target threshold, not exceeded). **β-side process notes (deferred to γ):** β's `Monitor` polling missed three α-branch transitions during the round-2 dispatch window (suspected `git fetch --quiet` silent failure masked by transition-only stdout filter; operator surfaced manually); β's R1 verdict initially landed on the harness-given β-side branch rather than α's cycle branch, requiring γ-clarification to redirect — first-cycle-of-new-protocol expected friction. **Scoring.** α A- (clean implementation, two re-audit misses — F1 self-contradiction was structural, F4 was a missed-during-pivot drift). β A (F1 surfaced with 5-surface enumeration and 3 candidate resolutions named; F2 caught via §2.2.8 authority-surface enumeration against 5 peers; R2 narrowing decisive; β-side polling-failure self-observed and surfaced as factual observation per voice rule). γ A- (clean dispatch with mid-cycle simplification of `{N}/{role}.md` → `{N}/`-with-descriptive-filenames; decisive F1 resolution to branch-polling canonical; merge-ownership Socratic check confirmed β cited spec correctly). **Diff level L7** (system-shaping MCA: PR-polling friction class eliminated; two-surface polling collapses to one channel; cycle-dir state derived from branch-head transitions). **Cycle cap L5** (γ PRA revised β's provisional L6 cap downward: two §9.1 triggers fired — (a) cross-surface drift reached review via F2/F3/F4 in lifecycle skills `release/`, `post-release/`, missed by α's role-skill-only re-audit; (b) avoidable tooling failure via β's `Monitor` `git fetch --quiet` polling silent failure dropping three α-branch SHA transitions in the round-2 window. Both are L6-level §9.1 trigger fires; cycle level = L5). Invariants: dyad-plus-coordinator preserved (β owns review→merge→release→close-out per §1.5; γ owns coordination + PRA + cycle closure); δ-gate platform-action boundary clarified at `operator/SKILL.md` §3.1 (β decides merge; δ executes the platform `git push` when env restricts). |
| 3.60.0 | A | A | A | A- | L6 (cycle cap: L5) | **`cn build --check` validates command entrypoints + skill SKILL.md presence** (#235, PR #276). `pkgbuild.CheckOne` previously only checked structural presence of content-class directories; a package could declare `commands.daily.entrypoint = "commands/daily/cn-daily"` with the file missing, or ship a `skills/orphan/` subtree with no `SKILL.md`, and `cn build --check` would pass — broken tarballs shipped. Two new validation passes close that gap. **AC1 (`checkCommandEntrypoints`)** reads `cn.package.json` via the canonical `pkg.ParseFullManifestData` (eng/go §2.17 "one parser per fact" — no parallel parser introduced) and verifies every declared command's entrypoint resolves to an existing regular file under the package root, rejecting missing files, non-regular targets (e.g. directory at the entrypoint path), path-traversal (`../`), and empty entrypoints. **AC2 (`checkSkillDirectories` + `containsSkillMd`)** walks every top-level subdirectory of `skills/` and demands at least one `SKILL.md` somewhere in the subtree — same filesystem-as-authority surface as activation's `discoverPackageSkills` (#261, DESIGN-CONSTRAINTS §1). Top-level scope is intentionally narrow: namespace containers like `cnos.eng/skills/eng/` (no SKILL.md, all sub-skills do) and resource subdirectories like `cnos.core/skills/naturalize/references/` (no SKILL.md needed) are exempt by construction. 9 tests cover pass + fail + exempt cases for both ACs. Both new error classes flow through the existing I1 `coherence-build-check` job's exit-code gate; α verified end-to-end via deliberate-break repro on `cnos.cdd`. **Cycle shape:** 1 review round, 0 findings on the diff itself, CI 7/7 green at `f7d27b4`. **§9.1 trigger fired:** "avoidable tooling/environmental failure" + "loaded skill failed to prevent a finding" — β's first synchronous PR-existence check after the new-branch transition event used `mcp__github__list_pull_requests head=usurobor:claude/alpha-tier-3-skills-M8Vce` and trusted the empty result; PR #276 was already open with that head ref but the filter silently dropped the match. Operator caught it within one polling tick. Recommended `CDD.md §Tracking` patch (β finding, deferred to γ): the MCP `head=` filter and `gh pr list --search 'closes:#N'` qualifier are unreliable; on any new-branch transition event do a synchronous broad open-PR list (no head/search filter) and scan client-side for `(head.ref == new-branch) OR (body matches (?i)\b(closes\|fixes\|resolves\|refs)\s*#N\b)`. Same shape as the existing baseline rule, extended from session-start to per-event handling. **Notes (deferred to γ, not findings against the diff):** N1 — pre-existing `pkgbuild.PackageManifest` minimal-shape parser still duplicates `pkg.PackageManifest`; α's PR body §Known debt names this; eliminating it changes `DiscoveredPackage.Manifest`'s static type. N2 — `BuildOne` does not gate on `CheckOne`, so `cn build` (without `--check`) still tarballs unvalidated; pre-existing structure, CI runs `--check` separately. N3 — `os.Stat` follows symlinks; symlink entrypoint to a regular file outside pkgDir would pass the regular-file check; pre-existing concern. N4 — issue body cites stale `docs/alpha/INVARIANTS.md` (canonical: `docs/alpha/architecture/INVARIANTS.md`); γ-side issue-quality, did not affect implementation. **Scoring.** α A (zero-finding cycle, canonical parser reused, contract-implementation confinement clean — empty-entrypoint and path-traversal rejection added beyond strict AC wording). β A (review covered every AC + named docs + CDD artifacts + 11 sibling-consistency checks; surfaced own review-skill miss as explicit finding for γ rather than letting it stand). γ A- (issue dispatch high-quality with named DESIGN-CONSTRAINTS and Tier 3 skills; one process drift surfaced — issue body's stale INVARIANTS path; harness branch naming `claude/alpha-tier-3-skills-M8Vce` continues §3.59.0's non-canonical pattern per CDD §4.2). **Diff level L6** (cross-surface coherence: validator integrates cleanly with activation/discover, uses canonical `pkg.ContentClasses`/`pkg.ClassSkills`/`pkg.ParseFullManifestData`, no parallel authority introduced). **Cycle cap L5** (β tooling miss reached operator-correction rather than being self-caught; recovery was fast but the friction was visible). Invariants: T-002 (kernel minimal) preserved — validator stays in `internal/pkgbuild/`, `cli/cmd_build.go` unchanged. T-004 (source/artifact/installed explicit) tightened — build-time check converts what was a silent runtime-time degradation into a noisy build-time failure. INV-001 (one package substrate) preserved. DESIGN-CONSTRAINTS §1 (filesystem-as-authority for skills) tightened — build-check and activation now share one authority surface. §3.2 (dispatch boundary) preserved.

The install authority chain (lockfile → installed `cn.package.json` → released binary) was silently lying: `restore.restoreOne` skipped reinstall whenever the version-less `VendorPath` already existed, so a lockfile bump from `cnos.core@1.0.0` → `2.0.0` was silently ignored, and there was no automated check that a freshly released `cn` binary could bootstrap a fresh hub from production endpoints (the v3.x `packages/index.json` migration leak was found by accident, not by a named test). **Restore (AC1+AC2):** `restore.restoreOne` now reads the installed manifest via the new `restore.ReadInstalledManifest` IO wrapper around `pkg.ParseInstalledManifestData` (additive `Version` field on `pkg.PackageManifest`; existing `ValidatePackageManifestData` reuses the same pure parser) and compares against the lockfile pin — same version → fast-path skip (perf preserved); drift, unreadable, or missing manifest → `slog.WarnContext` + `os.RemoveAll` + reinstall, so v1-only files cannot leak into the v2 install. `TestRestoreVersionDriftReinstalls` is the anti-overlay regression: pre-installs v1 with a `v1-only-marker` file, bumps lockfile to v2, asserts after restore that (a) the manifest version is 2.0.0, (b) the v2-only marker is present, and (c) the v1-only marker is **absent** — the wipe is what the test names. `TestRestoreUnreadableManifestReinstalls` covers the half-state branch. **Doctor (AC6):** `doctor.checkPackages` reads each installed `cn.package.json` and compares its `version` to the lockfile pin via the same shared pure parser (round-2 F1 fix — see below); reports `StatusFail` with a stale list naming `(installed X, locked Y)`, `(no manifest)`, or `(unparseable manifest)` so the runtime surface no longer agrees with the silent-skip lie. `TestRunAllPackageVersionDrift`, `TestRunAllPackageManifestMissing`, and `TestRunAllPackageManifestUnparseable` cover all three diagnostics. **Smoke (AC3+AC4+AC5):** `scripts/smoke/90-release-bootstrap.sh` exercises the full chain from a fresh empty directory — download `cn-<platform>` + `index.json` + every referenced tarball from the GitHub release URL, verify each tarball's SHA-256 against the `index.json[name][version].sha256` entry (the same authority `cn deps restore` itself trusts at runtime — single source of truth, no checksums.txt detour), then `cn init` + `cn setup` + assert default deps resolvable in the released index + `cn deps lock` + `cn deps restore` + verify each pinned package landed at the expected version. `api.github.com/zen` network probe → exit 2 (`RESULT: skipped (offline)`) when offline so a transient API outage doesn't red-flag a healthy release. `.github/workflows/release-smoke.yml` runs the smoke on `release: types: [published]` (4-platform matrix: linux-x64, linux-arm64, macos-x64, macos-arm64) — rc=2 → `::warning::`, rc=1 → `::error::`. **release.yml ldflags:** build step now stamps `-ldflags "-X main.version=${{ github.ref_name }}"` so the released binary's compile-time `version` equals the release tag; without this, `cn setup` writes deps.json with `version="dev"` and `cn deps lock` cannot resolve packages in the released index — i.e. the smoke would correctly fail. **Cycle shape:** 2 review rounds (target ≤2), 4 findings R1 (F1 C judgment, F2 B judgment, F3 B judgment, F4 A mechanical), all four addressed on-branch in one round-2 commit; 0 findings R2; CI 7/7 green at `93ea1d6`. Mechanical ratio 25% (1/4) but absolute count below the §9.1 ≥10-finding threshold so the trigger is informational. **§9.1 trigger fired:** "loaded skill failed to prevent a finding" — `eng/go` §2.17 (Parse vs Read) was loaded by α and `doctor.checkPackages` still introduced a parallel anonymous-struct unmarshal of `cn.package.json` (F1 C); β caught it via review §2.2.8 authority-surface conflict, α fixed cleanly in round 2. The §2.17 skill text already covers the failure mode in the abstract; the gap is that "do not reintroduce a parallel parser when a new pure parser is added in the same PR" is a sharpening case worth surfacing in γ's PRA. **β-side process notes (deferred to γ):** harness branch name `claude/alpha-tier-3-skills-IZOsO` is non-canonical per CDD §4.2 (`{agent}/{issue}-{scope}`) — α PR body acknowledged "(per dispatch)"; β polling Monitor's first-iteration absorption silently swallowed a pre-existing PR (CDD §Tracking template lacks a synchronous-baseline step before transition-only polling); narrow branch-glob filter missed scope-encoded harness branches (issue number not in the branch name). **Scoring.** α A- (5 of 6 ACs implemented cleanly first pass; F1 was a parse/read-purity violation in α's own diff that the §2.17 skill should have prevented at authoring time; F2–F4 are smaller — header/dead-code drift in the smoke, missing third-branch test). β A (caught all four findings with precise evidence; round-2 narrowing was sharp; verification at `93ea1d6` walked diff-only and CI-only, no scope creep). γ A- (cycle clean, dispatch issue was high-quality with full ACs and named DESIGN-CONSTRAINTS — but two process gaps surface here for γ iteration: harness branch-naming drift vs CDD §4.2, and the synchronous-baseline gap in §Tracking polling). **Diff level L7** (the cycle ships an MCA that eliminates the silent-skip + bootstrap-leak failure class — restore reads its own authority, doctor surfaces drift visibly, smoke fires on every published release, ldflags pins the binary's self-description to its tag). **Cycle cap L6** (F1 authority-sync drift reached review per §9.1; cycle did not earn L7 cleanly). Invariants: DESIGN-CONSTRAINTS §1 (one source of truth) tightened — `pkg.ParseInstalledManifestData` is now the single parser for installed-manifest version across `restore` and `doctor`; §2.2 (source/artifact/installed clarity) tightened — installed `cn.package.json` is now an explicit authority surface; §3.2 (dispatch boundary) preserved — domain logic stays in `restore`/`doctor`/`pkgbuild`, no new logic added to `cli/`; §6.3 (degraded-path visibility) preserved — every reinstall reason is `slog.Warn`'d and every doctor stale-state branch produces a named diagnostic. T-002, T-004 preserved-tightened. No OCaml files modified (§5.0). |

I3 now rebuilds from source and compares checksums. `cn build` derives packlist from content-class model (#262, PR #265) — `pkg.ContentClasses` shared constant, stray files excluded. Tarballs are deterministic (#264) — zeroed tar/gzip headers, Go 1.24 pinned across CI. **CDD hardening (15 skill commits):** agent compliance gap closed — skill instructions are imperative and override system-prompt defaults (PR creation, subscribe, reply to RC, β refuse-to-implement); β polling loop replaces unreliable GH event subscriptions; §1.4 generic large-file authoring rule replaces 4 per-step duplicates; close-out voice constraint (observations only, triage is γ's); dispatch model changed — γ produces both prompts, β starts intake immediately. CDD package audit committed (34 findings → #268). **CTB §8.5.1:** four skills-language evidence items (global aspects, authority hierarchy, visibility, dependency graph). eng/go §2.13 extended with cross-toolchain determinism. **Cycles:** #264 (small-change, Sigma direct), #262 (3 review rounds, 7 findings, partial — AC1/AC5 deferred), #266 (3 review rounds, γ close-out triaged 6 items with 2 immediate MCA skill patches). α A- (cross-cycle: 6 review rounds total, mechanical base-drift × 2, cross-toolchain discovery). β A- (caught all D/C findings, polling gap surfaced, role-violation correctly refused). γ A- (15 skill patches shipped as immediate MCA, audit filed, design decisions made for #266 + #268). |
| 3.57.0 | A- | A- | A- | A- | L6 (cycle cap: L6) | **Go skill activation: filesystem discovery + frontmatter visibility** (#261, PR #263). `src/go/internal/activation/` replaces the OCaml-only activation path with a Go-side discovery + validate + index that walks `<hub>/.cn/vendor/packages/<pkg>/skills/` for every SKILL.md on disk — no `sources.skills` manifest field consulted. `ParseFrontmatter` (pure) reads YAML-subset frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `triggers`, `visibility`) supporting both block lists (`triggers:\n  - a`) and inline flow sequences (`triggers: [a, b, c]`); handles CRLF, BOM, malformed lines. `Discover`/`BuildIndex`/`Validate` (IO) wrap the parser. `BuildIndex` excludes `visibility: internal` and defaults absent visibility to public. `ValidateSkills` reports three issue kinds (unreadable/malformed SKILL.md, empty triggers, trigger conflicts across public skills — internal skills are excluded from conflict detection because they are not addressable via the activation index). `doctor.RunAll` wires a `skill activation` check with a severity split: `IssueMissingSkill` → `StatusFail` (structural break), `IssueEmptyTriggers` + `IssueTriggerConflict` → `StatusInfo` (keywords are many-to-many activation hints — overlapping keywords are a legitimate authoring pattern, surfaced as ○ warnings without escalating the hub). `PACKAGE-AUTHORING.md` §8 rewrites the manifest-contract paragraph (manifest owns commands/engines; filesystem owns content classes) and drops "if it's not in the manifest, the runtime doesn't know about it"; `PACKAGE-ARTIFACTS.md` replaces `sources.skills` examples with filesystem-walk + `visibility: internal` narrative. 33 activation tests (incl. `TestDiscover_RealCoreSkills_HaveTriggers` and `TestValidate_RealCorpus_NoEmptyTriggers` — walks every `src/packages/*/skills/**/SKILL.md` into a temp hub and asserts Validate returns no empty-triggers). 10 doctor tests. **Cycle shape:** 3 review rounds (above target 2), 4 findings across rounds. F1 (D): `ParseFrontmatter` round-1 silently dropped inline YAML flow-sequence triggers, the dominant format in 42 of 52 production SKILL.md files — fixed at 9cfd3c9 by adding `parseInlineList` (6 LOC). F3 (B): `flushList` only materialised the `triggers` buffer; renamed to `pendingItems` with switch dispatch on `pendingListKey` so a future block-list field (e.g. `aliases:`) extends one case. F2 (C): `Package dist/source sync (I3)` was red on the PR but is a pre-existing main defect (non-deterministic `createTarGz` in `pkgbuild/build.go:185` — `tar.FileInfoHeader` captures live ModTime, `gzip.NewWriter` captures current time); filed as #264 with concrete fix (zero `hdr.ModTime`/`AccessTime`/`ChangeTime`, set `gw.Header.ModTime = time.Time{}`) per review §7.0 design-scope deferral. F4 (D): the F1 fix exposed that the real cnos.core corpus has 9 genuine trigger-keyword overlaps across public skills (`coherence`, `alignment`, `drift`, `boundary`, `onboard`, `reflect`, `self-check`, `sync`, `verify`) — addressed at 7e76798 by (A) filtering internal skills out of conflict detection (mirrors OCaml-era `manifest_skill_ids` semantics) and (B) γ-directed design decision to model cnos activation triggers as many-to-many hints rather than exclusive dispatches, downgrading overlaps to `StatusInfo` warnings while keeping unreadable SKILL.md files as `StatusFail`. **§9.1 triggers fired:** review rounds > 2 (3 actual); loaded skills failed to prevent F1 (running `cn doctor` against a freshly restored hub at authoring time would have caught the inline-list gap — the two real-corpus integration tests landed in round 2 are the MCA that prevents future recurrence). **Divergence from OCaml severity mapping:** OCaml `cn_doctor.ml:46-49` treated `Trigger_conflict` as fatal and Missing/Empty as warn; the new Go mapping inverts this (Missing = fatal, Conflict/Empty = warn) because the operator-ratified model is that overlapping trigger keywords are intentional authoring, not a hub break — a real semantic change for downstream tooling that grep-ed for ✗ skill activation. **I3 remains red on this release** (deferred per #264, pre-existing on main). α A- (3-round cycle; round 1 missed both inline-list format and corpus-conflict pattern that a quick `cn doctor` run would have surfaced; rounds 2–3 investigation was sharp — separating Bug A from Bug B was the right call). β A- (caught F1/F2/F3/F4 with precise evidence; round-2 approval correctly flagged F4 as design-scope deferral; accepted γ-authorised inline resolution in round 3; divergence from OCaml severity mapping surfaced but not framed as a blocker). γ A- (directed the round-3 "downgrade to warning" path, collapsing the F4 follow-up into the PR rather than spawning a separate cycle — legitimate operator override, recorded here for audit trail). Invariants: T-004 (source/artifact/installed explicit) preserved — filesystem is now the single source of truth for skill existence; `visibility: internal` frontmatter fields added on 9 CDD sub-skills are now effective. T-002, T-003, INV-001, INV-003 preserved. No OCaml files modified (§5.0). The real-corpus integration test pattern (walk every src/packages/*/skills/**/SKILL.md into a temp hub) is an L6 MCA ready to be extended to conflict detection once authoring conventions settle. |
| 3.56.2 | A | A | A | A | L6 (diff: L7; cycle cap: L6) | **`cn deps lock` honors `deps.json`** (#250, PR #259). `restore.GenerateLockFromIndex` was iterating the full package index and writing every `(name, version)` pair into `.cn/deps.lock.json` — pins in `deps.json` had no effect and `cn deps restore` over-vendored every package the hub knew about. Fix: `pkg.ParseManifest` (pure) + `restore.ReadManifest` (IO wrapper, mirroring the §2.17 purity split) read the operator manifest; the generator then iterates `m.Packages` and resolves each pin via `idx.Lookup(name, version)`. Unresolved pins are collected into one explicit error naming every missing `name@version` rather than silently dropped. Missing `deps.json` now errors rather than succeeding with an index dump. Six AC-named tests cover single-pin / duplicate-free / restore-only-pinned / missing-manifest / missing-pin / default-profile — all six fail on the buggy code, pass on the fix. Go/OCaml lockfile-generation semantics now agree (`src/ocaml/cmd/cn_deps.ml` `lockfile_for_manifest` already did this correctly — #259 closes the discrepancy, not introduces one). **CI harness sync:** the kata Tier-1 `06-install.sh` post-condition and Tier-2 hub setup in `ci.yml` both relied on the bug; fix exposed two latent errors (Tier-1 pinned to binary `"dev"` version, Tier-2 used object-syntax `{"name":"version"}` which the parser rejects as `[]ManifestDep`). Both now derive real versions from `src/packages/*/cn.package.json` and use the canonical array schema. `cnos.kata` `lib.sh` `write_deps_json` emits the correct shape; `pkg_version_from_source` helper added and threaded into R3/R4 katas (no more hardcoded `3.54.0`). 1 review round, 0 findings, CI 7/7 green on `44d431a`. α: A — purity boundary preserved, error policy explicit, determinism preserved, Go/OCaml parity restored. β: A — independent build + race-test + manual revert-to-bug verification on the worktree; module-truth and sibling-fallback audits both clean. γ: A — dispatch clean, issue scoped precisely (semver/transitive explicitly out-of-scope), cycle closed in ≤1 round. **Scoring convergence (α↔β):** α close-out scored diff-shape L7 (silent-success fallback removed — malformed manifests and stale pins now surface at lock time rather than being masked into quiet over-installs) and cycle-process L6 (Go code L5-clean on first push; two pre-review CI iterations surfaced three bug-masked test-harness defects — Tier-1 weak post-condition, Tier-2 object-syntax schema mismatch, `cnos.kata` `write_deps_json` same schema mismatch — all fixed in the same PR). β originally scored L5 (CHANGELOG at release time), revised to L6 during assessment to converge with α; L7 diff-shape is credible but cycle-level is capped at L6 per §9.1 (some surface drift surfaced at CI rather than authoring time). Invariants: T-004 (source/artifact/installed explicit) tightened — lockfile now mechanically derives from manifest intent rather than ambient index state; T-002, T-003, INV-001, INV-003 preserved. §9.1 triggers: none fired at review time (review rounds 1, mechanical ratio 0/0, no loaded skill failed to prevent a review finding). **Skill gap surfaced in α close-out:** `eng/go` §2.12 schema-and-compatibility covers Go code handling manifests but does not scope to sibling shell test harnesses producing JSON for the same parsers — that gap allowed `cnos.kata/lib.sh`'s `write_deps_json` schema mismatch to survive to CI discovery rather than authoring-time audit. β concurs with α's proposed one-line addendum and **shipped it as immediate output** (§10.1): §2.12 now includes "sibling harnesses are contract surfaces too" with a mechanical grep form. Known debt: `cn setup`'s binary-version pin (#unfiled follow-up candidate) — in dev/CI environments without `-ldflags`, `cn deps lock` now errors explicitly rather than silently succeeding. Issue #250 scope intentionally excludes semver resolution and transitive dependencies; both remain as listed follow-ups if/when the manifest schema grows a `dependencies` field. |

Converged to a single authoritative list: `pkg.ContentClasses` (pure-types package, exported, 8 entries in canonical §1.1 order) + `pkgbuild.FindContentClasses(pkgDir)` (shared filesystem predicate used by both `cn build --check` and `cn status`). Removed the JSON-field heuristic entirely: `FullPackageManifest.ContentClasses()` method, `Skills`/`Orchestrators`/`Extensions`/`Providers` fields, and the now-orphaned `SkillsJSON` type all deleted — presence on disk is the single authority (PACKAGE-SYSTEM.md §3). `providers` correctly removed as never-a-content-class (it's a runtime capability surface per POLYGLOT-PACKAGES-AND-PROVIDERS.md). Doctrine synced: PACKAGE-SYSTEM.md §1.1 adds `katas` row (8th class — completes the v3.55.0 drift where pkgbuild gained katas but doctrine didn't), §1.2 "directory tree copy" enumeration now includes katas (F1 narrowing round), §3 names `pkg.ContentClasses` and `pkgbuild.FindContentClasses` as the implementation, §4.1/§4.3 counts corrected 7→8, §6 history gains v3.55.0 (katas-added) and v3.56.1 (convergence) rows. 4 new tests covering empty/full/subset/cn-status-end-to-end paths; real packages still validate. 2 review rounds (target ≤2), 1 finding (F1: B mechanical — §1.2 sibling doc row stale after §1.1 update), fixed on-branch in `507e1e8`. α A- because the CDD §5.3 row 7a schema/shape audit missed the §1.1 ↔ §1.2 peer-enumeration pair (table column ↔ prose bullet restating the same column); α close-out proposes a concrete one-line row 7a addendum as MCA, pending γ triage. β A because the divergence was caught by review §2.2.8 authority-surface audit, narrowed cleanly, and review converged in 2 rounds. γ A because the dispatch chain ran cleanly and the cycle closed within target economics (both close-outs committed directly to main per §1.4 step 11). Invariants: T-005 (finite content classes) preserved-tightened — still 8, now single-sourced. §9.1 trigger: loaded skill failed to prevent a finding (row 7a scope gap); MCA candidate proposed and pending γ ship decision. Mechanical ratio 100% (1/1); total findings < 10 so no process issue filed per post-release §5.5. **Cycle level L5** (L6 cap — doc-internal coherence drift reached review); release diff level L6 (all shipped surfaces agree end-to-end). |
| 3.56.0 | A | A | A- | A- | L6 | **Git-style subcommand dispatch** (#254, PR #257). `cn <noun> <verb>` is now the primary command surface — `ResolveCommand` in `internal/cli/dispatch.go` resolves noun-verb pairs to flat commands, with flat-hyphenated form preserved as backward-compat fallback. `cn help <noun>` lists grouped verbs. Lookup order: noun-verb first, flat fallback second. 14 dispatch tests + 2 help tests, AC1–AC5 met. Design pre-converged in DESIGN-CONSTRAINTS §3.1 (1a7c362) — α cycle was pure MCA. 1 review round, 0 findings, β approved Round 1. α close-out: L6-clean, no §9.1 triggers. **Process note:** α close-out was committed on PR branch and destroyed by squash-merge; had to be recovered to main manually — exposed that `.cdd/` artifacts must be committed to main directly, not on PR branches. β did not produce post-release assessment (completed by σ). α: A (zero-finding cycle, design pre-converged, self-coherence applied at authoring time). β: A- (clean review, but failed to produce post-release assessment — closure gap recurring from 3.55.0). γ: A- (cycle dispatched correctly, but did not enforce closure artifact collection from β). |
| 3.55.0 | A | A- | A | A | L7 | **Kata framework separated from kata content; CDD triadic protocol operationalized** (#251 primary, PR #252; bundles #246/#247, #237/#248, and direct-to-main CDD skill patches). **L7 move:** `cnos.kata` 0.2.0 is now the kata framework — `cn kata-run`, `cn kata-list`, `cn kata-judge` — discovering katas across any installed package via the `<pkg>/katas/<id>/kata.md` convention (class parsed from `**Class:** <runtime\|method>`). `cnos.cdd.kata` 0.3.0 becomes content-only (no commands). The class of work "wire up a kata system for a new domain" is eliminated — a future `cnos.eng.kata` / `cnos.ops.kata` just drops a `katas/` dir. `pkgbuild.ContentClasses` expanded 7 → 8 to recognize `katas/` as a first-class package content directory. **Release hardening (#247):** the Tier 1 kata suite now runs inside the release workflow's build matrix on all 4 platforms between Package and Upload — a per-platform fresh-compile regression on the shipped binary is now structurally blocked from publishing. **Tier 2 runtime kata (#248):** `cnos.kata` ships R1 (command dispatch), R2 (author→build→install→dispatch round-trip in isolated tempdir), R3 (`cn doctor` catches chmod -x on installed entrypoint), R4 (`cn status` surfaces installed package + commands); `kata-tier2` CI job gates. **Process (direct-to-main):** identity format converged on `role@cdd.project` (was `<hub>-<role>@cnos.xyz`); CDD.md named canonical and SKILL.md demoted to loader (single source of truth); §1.4 roles rewritten as dyad + coordinator; §4.4 skill tiers formalized; α/β close-outs into γ cycle iteration; γ triage uses CAP; project-vs-agent MCI distinction (§11.12); `cn cdd-verify --version <v> [--triadic]` command added for artifact completeness (c24c75f3). **.cdd/ Phase 1:** first triadic protocol artifacts landed (`.cdd/releases/3.55.0/gamma/CLOSE-OUT.md`, `.cdd/releases/3.55.0/alpha/251.md`, and this release's beta assessment). **Cycle shape:** 2 reviewed PRs (2 rounds each); PR #248 had 1 mechanical finding (D stale-rebase), 1 structural-test bug (C), 1 filed-as-issue (A, became #250); PR #252 had 2C + 1B, all closed on Round 2 with zero new findings introduced. Mechanical ratio 33% on #251 cycle (F2 dual-source) → §9.1 fired; remediation: §2.5b check 6 sharpened to reject addition-only audits (MCA shipped in 89a1b2f). α: A- because two cycles surfaced mechanical findings a sharper §2.5b would have caught. β: A because both cycles closed in ≤2 rounds with explicit narrowing. γ: A because triage was issued, close-outs wired, and the MCA→shipped loop reduced cycle cap from L5 to L7 for the primary refactor. Invariants: T-005 preserved-tightened (finite set grew from 7 to 8); T-002, T-003, INV-001, INV-003 all preserved. |
| 3.54.0 | A | A | A | A | L6 | **Tier 1 bare-binary kata suite + CI gate** (#236, PR #239). Six executable kata scripts (`scripts/kata/0{1..6}-*.sh`) prove the `cn` binary works end-to-end before any package is installed: help → init → status → doctor → build → install. `run-all.sh` stops on first failure; CI job `kata-tier1` (needs `go`) gates merges. Three-tier kata catalog: Tier 1 bare binary (this release), Tier 2 runtime/package (#237), Tier 3 method/CDD (`cnos.cdd.kata`). Two Go preconditions: `cn help` always lists the 8 kernel commands with `(requires hub)` annotation when no hub; `cn doctor` gains three-way Status (Pass/Info/Fail → ✓/○/✗) so fresh-hub pending artifacts (deps.lock.json, runtime contract, origin remote, vendor before any lock) report informationally instead of failing. Dead `Registry.Available()` removed. 1 review round, 0 D/C findings, all architecture checks pass (§2.2.14.G improved — degraded paths now visible via `○` glyph). T-002 preserved (cmd_doctor/cmd_help remain thin wrappers, CI dispatch-boundary grep green). T-003 preserved (stdlib-only). γ+β collapse per CDD §1.4 (operator-authorized). |
| 3.53.0 | A | A | A | A | L5 | **cn status surfaces installed packages and command registry** (#233, PR #234). Go kernel Phase 4 completion: `cn status` reads cn.package.json manifests from vendor dirs (not dir names), displays name/version/content classes, shows command registry grouped by tier (kernel/repo-local/package) with source attribution. Version drift compares `engines.cnos` from manifest against running binary. `hubstatus` accepts pure `CommandInfo` data type from cli layer — no import cycle. 6 tests. 1 review round, 0 blockers (2 A-level), all architecture checks pass. T-002 preserved (cmd_status.go thin wrapper). T-004 preserved (installed state read from manifests). INV-003 preserved (commands/skills/orchestrators distinct in content class display). MVA Step 4 (#228) complete; #192 AC4 met. |
| 3.52.0 | A | A | A | A- | L6 | **Package and repo-local command discovery + dispatch** (#226, PR #231). Go kernel Phase 4: three source forms (kernel, repo-local, package) normalized into one registry, one dispatch. `internal/discover/` owns scanning + exec. `ExecCommand` dispatches via subprocess with `CN_HUB_PATH`/`CN_PACKAGE_ROOT` env vars. `cn help` shows tiered output with `[pkg-name]` attribution. `cn doctor` validates command integrity (missing/non-exec entrypoints, duplicates). Path confinement on manifest entrypoints. 13 new tests. 1 review round, 4 findings (0D, 1B mechanical, 3B/A judgment), all fixed on-branch. T-002 preserved (cmd_*.go thin wrappers, CI-enforced). INV-003 preserved (commands dispatch, no surface conflation). INV-004 preserved (kernel owns precedence). |
| 3.51.0 | A | A | A | A- | L5 | **Distribution pipeline proved end-to-end** (#227, PR #229). `src/packages/ → cn build → dist/ → cn deps restore → .cn/vendor/packages/` round-trip verified with `TestBuildRestoreRoundTrip`. 3 mismatches fixed: VendorPath aligned to BUILD-AND-DIST.md (version-less), local file restore for dev workflow, `cn deps lock` subcommand. Lockfile types consolidated on `pkg.Lockfile`/`pkg.LockedDep`. T-004 tightened. 2 review rounds, 5 findings all resolved. Known debt: #230 (version upgrade skip). |
| 3.50.0 | A+ | A+ | A+ | A+ | L7 | **Go kernel Phase 3 complete.** Slice D: `update` + `setup` commands (#212, PR #225). `cn update` fetches latest release, SHA-256 verifies, atomic installs. `cn update --check` for dry run. `cn setup` creates .cn/, agent/, default deps.json, .gitignore. All 8 kernel commands implemented: help, init, setup, deps, status, doctor, build, update. 63 Go tests. eng/design-principles skill (L6): Parnas/Martin/Liskov + cnos-specific rules. CDD review §2.2.14 architecture check (7 questions A-G) + §2.3.5 verdict gate — turns design principles into a mechanical review gate. BUILD-AND-DIST migration steps explicit. T-004 premature canonicalization fixed. I1 caught design-principles manifest drift — first real coherence CI catch on main. α A+ (all 8 commands, dispatch boundary CI-enforced). β A+ (design-principles skill + architecture review gate). γ A+ (full CDD invariants chain complete: author→handoff→review→close→CI). |
| 3.49.0 | A+ | A | A+ | A+ | L5 | cli/ extraction (#221, PR #222): dispatch boundary enforced. Domain logic extracted from cli/ to internal/doctor/, internal/hubinit/, internal/hubstatus/. FindIndexPath moved to internal/restore/. CI dispatch boundary check added — INVARIANTS.md T-002 is now mechanical. cmd_doctor 238→44 lines, cmd_init 131→27, cmd_status 76→27. INVARIANTS.md v1.2.0: title normalized, stale references cleaned. α A+ because the purity boundary is now machine-enforced, not just review-enforced. γ A+ because the CDD invariants chain (author→handoff→review→close) produced its first mechanicalization. |
| 3.48.0 | A | A+ | A+ | A+ | L7 | Go kernel Phase 3 Slice C: `build` command (#219, PR #220). Three modes: build (tarball + index + checksums), check (CI drift detection), clean. Pure/IO split in `pkgbuild` package. Architectural invariants doc (INVARIANTS.md): 6 active invariants, 5 transition constraints, 3 process constraints — validated each CDD cycle. CDD lifecycle integration: project invariants loaded at §2.4 (pre-code), §2.5a item 5 (handoff), §2.2.13 (review), §6a (post-release). eng/go §2.17 (Parse/Read purity boundary) + §2.18 (cli/ dispatch boundary) — both derive from INVARIANTS.md. Build-and-Distribution design doc: independent package versioning, src/packages/ → dist/packages/ → .cn/vendor/. β A+ because the architectural constraint surface is now explicit and validated. γ A+ because the CDD self-learning loop now covers invariant preservation end-to-end. |
| 3.47.0 | A | A | A+ | A | L6 | Go kernel Phase 3 Slice B: `doctor` command (#212, PR #217). Hub health validation across 5 categories: prerequisites (git, curl), hub structure (.cn/config, SOUL.md, peers), package system (deps.json, deps.lock, installed packages + version drift), runtime contract (v2 four-layer validation), git remote. 30 Go tests. 2 review findings (F1: optional file severity, F2: test assertion gap), both fixed on-branch per §7.0. Architecture design docs: git-cn package design (#218), package restructuring target (#186), capabilities field added to cn.extension.v1 (no new manifest type). β A+ because the design frontier is now fully explicit: polyglot packages, provider contract, package restructuring target, git-cn package shape. |
| 3.46.0 | A | A | A+ | A | L6 | Go kernel Phase 3 Slice A: `init` + `status` commands (#212, PR #213). Hub lifecycle pair — create hubs with full structure + inspect with version drift detection. Input validation confinement fix (#214, PR #215): bare-name validation rejects path traversal. Two architecture design docs: POLYGLOT-PACKAGES-AND-PROVIDERS.md (Go kernel + language-agnostic packages + command/provider contract split) and PROVIDER-CONTRACT-v1.md (subprocess protocol: spawn/handshake/describe/health/execute/shutdown, NDJSON over stdio, kernel-owned policy). 26 Go tests. eng/go stdlib rule. CI OPAMRETRIES fix. β A+ because design docs make the polyglot boundary explicit — provider contract is the missing concrete layer beneath runtime-extensions. |
| 3.45.0 | A | A+ | A | A | L7 | First runnable Go binary: `go build ./cmd/cn && ./cn deps restore`. CLI entrypoint with modular command dispatch per GO-KERNEL-COMMANDS.md v1.2 (#209, PR #210). `CommandSpec` + `Invocation` + `Command` interface + `Registry` with tier precedence and `Available(hasHub)`. `deps restore` and `help` commands. Hub discovery walks up from cwd. 20 Go tests. CDD §7.0 gate: all review findings must be resolved before merge — validated on first use (PR #211 fixed F2+F3 before merge). |
| 3.44.0 | A | A+ | A | A | L6 | Go purity boundary fixed: `internal/pkg/` is now truly pure (zero `os` imports). `Parse*` (pure, `[]byte`) vs `Read*` (IO, path) mirrors `src/lib/` vs `src/cmd/`. HTTP timeout added (300s, matching OCaml curl flags). Directory traversal check hardened with separator suffix. OCaml skill v2 shipped (L6 parity with Go/TypeScript). Two architecture design docs: GO-KERNEL-COMMANDS (the kernel is a package — `cn.package.v1`-compatible manifest, `CommandSpec` runtime descriptor, 3-tier precedence) and HYBRID-LLM-ROUTING (body-plane routing matrix, local/remote/escalation, receipts). β A+ because the Go module now mirrors the OCaml purity split exactly, and the command architecture converged through 3 review iterations to a clean design. |
| 3.43.0 | A | A | A | A | L7 | First Go code in cnos. `go/` subtree implements `cn deps restore` in Go as an additive kernel slice alongside OCaml (#205, #192 Phase 1). Pure types in `internal/pkg/` mirror `src/lib/cn_package.ml`; IO restore path in `internal/restore/` mirrors `src/cmd/cn_deps.ml`. 13 tests (7 pkg + 6 restore), stdlib-only, zero external deps. Go CI workflow added. 1 review round, 0 blockers, 4 non-blocking findings (F2: HTTP timeout, F3: traversal hardening, F4: purity boundary — all follow-up). First-push CI green. New system boundary: Go module coexists with OCaml. |
| 3.42.0 | A | A | A+ | A | L5 | Doc authority convergence + CDD self-learning. Beta package-system doc retired (#180) — the artifact-first model is now the sole authority, no competing Git-native narrative. CDD post-release skill gains mandatory hub memory writes (Step 7): daily reflection + adhoc thread update required before cycle close, with pre-publish gate checks. Proven by v3.41.0 compaction gap where assessment was written but hub memory was not. Release skill gains §2.6a branch cleanup: delete merged branches after tag+push. 13 stale branches cleaned. #192 Go kernel rewrite scoped to narrow 4-phase extraction with explicit non-goals. |
| 3.41.0 | A | A | A+ | A | L7 | Move 2 complete: pure-model gravity into `src/lib/`. Fourth and final slice ships `cn_frontmatter.ml` (12 pure surface items: frontmatter parser, activation validation types, manifest skill-id reader). `src/lib/` now holds 5 pure modules (cn_json, cn_package, cn_contract, cn_workflow_ir, cn_frontmatter) — every pure type and parser in the codebase. `src/cmd/` holds only IO. The Go kernel rewrite (#192) has its boundary contract. First cycle with zero review findings — §2.5b checks 7+8 (#198) validated. CDD §1.4 Roles formalized: two-agent minimum for substantial cycles, reviewer is default releaser, Role column added to lifecycle table. TypeScript skill converged (schema-backed boundaries, branded primitives, explicit error policy, idempotence/receipts). |
| 3.40.0 | A | A | A | A | L6 | Pure-model gravity: Move 2 slices 2+3 (#182). Runtime contract types extracted into `src/lib/cn_contract.ml` (11 types + `zone_to_string` + transitive `activation_entry`). Workflow IR types, parser, validator, and helpers extracted into `src/lib/cn_workflow_ir.ml` (6 types + 10 pure functions — largest `src/lib/` module). `src/lib/` now holds 4 modules (cn_json, cn_package, cn_contract, cn_workflow_ir) covering the two largest pure surfaces. Type-equality re-export pattern validated at scale (6-variant + 7-variant types). Option-(b) principle established: pure types stay in `src/cmd/` when no `src/lib/` consumer exists. CDD §2.5b gate extended with checks 7 (library-name uniqueness) + 8 (CI-green-before-review). Go skill (`eng/go`) converged through 4 iterations — runtime/kernel craft + cnos-specific systems rules. 2 review rounds each for slices 2+3. Move 2 is 3/4 complete; 1 remaining (activation evaluator). |
| 3.38.0 | A | A | A | A | L5 | Pure-model gravity: first slice of Move 2 (#182). Package manifest, lockfile, and index types extracted from `src/cmd/cn_deps.ml` into `src/lib/cn_package.ml`. 6 types + 7 pure helpers + JSON round-trips. Cn_deps re-exports via OCaml type-equality (`type t = Cn_package.t = { ... }`) — zero caller migration. Purity discipline enforced: only stdlib + Cn_json imports. 11 ppx_expect tests (round-trips, parse, lookup, is_first_party). Dune lib comment documents the no-IO constraint. CORE-REFACTOR.md §7 status block added (3 remaining slices). 1 review round, 0 findings. Vision doc: AGENT-NETWORK.md committed (docs/alpha/vision/). |
| 3.37.0 | A- | A | A | B+ | L6 | Command pipeline symmetry (#184). Commands become the 7th content class in `cn build`: `src/agent/commands/<id>/` → `cn build` → `packages/<name>/commands/<id>/` → `cn deps restore` → vendor → runtime discovery. `daily`, `weekly`, `save` migrated from built-in OCaml to shell-script package commands in `cnos.core`. Built-in command set shrinks toward the bootstrap kernel (help, init, setup, deps, build, doctor, status, update). `cn_lib.ml` command variant, `cn.ml` dispatch, and `cn_gtd.ml` run_daily/run_weekly all cleaned. Dual-field manifest: `sources.commands` (string array for build pipeline) + top-level `commands` (object map for runtime metadata). `cn_command.ml` discovery/validation reads top-level `commands`; `cn_build.ml` reads `sources.commands`. `chmod +x` on `cn-*` entrypoints post-copy. 6 new build tests (AC1: copy+exec, clean, drift detection). PACKAGE-SYSTEM.md §1.1 updated. 3 review rounds (over ≤2 target — test fixture used old manifest schema, same root cause across two files, fix only caught one in R1), 1 finding (100% mechanical). Move 1 of #182 core refactor. |
| 3.36.0 | A | A | A | A- | L7 | Orchestrator IR runtime (#174). New execution surface: `cn.orchestrator.v1` mechanical workflow engine (`Cn_workflow`) — parse, validate, discover, execute. 6 step kinds: `op` (dispatches to typed ops via `Cn_executor.execute_op`), `if`/`match` (deterministic branching on bound scalars), `return`/`fail` (terminal), `llm` (guarded stub — parsed, validated, permission-checked, deferred to next cycle). Permission manifest enforced at both validator and executor (defence-in-depth). Execution trace via `Cn_trace.gemit` at every step boundary. `orchestrators/` added as 8th package content class in `cn_build` (source_decl, parse_sources, build/check/clean). `cn doctor` validates orchestrator manifests (load failures + schema issues, fail-stop). `build_orchestrator_registry` rewritten to consume `Cn_workflow.discover`, eliminating the #173 dueling-schema (`[{name, trigger_kinds}]` inline → `["id"]` string array per ORCHESTRATORS.md §9). `daily-review` shipped as first real orchestrator (schema-clean, not end-to-end runnable until `llm` step is wired). PACKAGE-SYSTEM.md §1.1 updated. Sibling audit: 5 pre-existing bare catches cleaned in `cn_build.ml`. 21 cn_workflow_test + 21 cn_runtime_contract_test (3 replaced). 2 review rounds, 5 findings R1 (2D mechanical: rebase artifact + stale README refs; 1C: `inputs` dead code; 2B: unvalidated field + missing `match` execution test), all closed R2. |
| 3.35.0 | A- | A | A- | B+ | L6 | Runtime contract: activation index + command/orchestrator registries (#173). Cognition layer now exposes `activation_index.skills` with declarative triggers from SKILL.md frontmatter. Body layer adds `commands` and `orchestrators` registries. Markdown/JSON parity enforced — markdown projection mirrors JSON schema shape. Silent error suppression eliminated: all manifest parse errors, malformed entries, and leaf-value coercions logged with package context in both `cn_runtime_contract.ml` and `cn_activation.ml`. Sibling audit applied across both modules. Design docs: ORCHESTRATORS.md v0.1.0 CTB connection (#172), #170 dependency graph cleaned. 21 expect-tests in runtime contract, 11 in activation. 3 review rounds on retro-findings PR. Process gap: PR #176 merged without CDD review — corrected via retro-review + findings PR #177. |
| 3.34.0 | A- | A- | A- | B+ | L7 | Package artifact distribution + commands content class (#167). Replaces git-based package restore with HTTP tarball fetch from package index. Lockfile v2: name+version+sha256 only — no source/rev/subdir. `commands` added as 7th package content class. `cn_command.ml`: discovery + dispatch (built-in > repo-local > package). `cn_help.ml`: lists external commands. `cn_doctor.ml`: validates command integrity. `scripts/build-packages.sh` + `packages/index.json` for release workflow. CDD §2.5a: delegated implementation handoff protocol + self-verification gate. CDD.md §5.3: step 6f (delegated handoff) added to artifact manifest. Architecture-evolution skill §5: five L7 diagnostic patterns. Also includes: #155 vendor offline-first + manual recognition, #161 self-update checksum verification, #146 review findings, review PRE-GATE check, release script. Design: PACKAGE-ARTIFACTS.md v0.5.0, ORCHESTRATORS.md v0.1.0 (#170 follow-up). 2 review rounds, 3 findings R1 (bare catches, missing tests, HTTP restore tests), all addressed R2. |
| 3.33.0 | A- | A | A- | A- | L6 | Harden installer: checksum verification, redirect detection, curated notes (#158). Version detection replaced GitHub API JSON parsing with HTTP redirect (`/releases/latest` Location header) — no jq dependency. Release workflow generates `checksums.txt` (SHA-256 per artifact), installer downloads and verifies (sha256sum/shasum, graceful degradation). RELEASE.md curated for v3.33.0. 1 review round, 1 minor finding (grep -F defensive hardening, non-blocking). |
| 3.32.0 | A- | A | A | A- | L6 | Systematic legacy fallback path audit (#152). 29 findings across touched files: 7 removed (dead deprecated functions + flat asset compat), 15 converted (silent `with _ ->` swallows to logged warnings), 7 kept (fail-closed patterns with justification). `run_inbound`, `feed_next_input`, `wake_agent` deleted (dead code since v3.27). All flat hub-path compat helpers deleted (package namespace only since v3.25). Zero bare `with _ ->` in any touched file. 5 review rounds, 7 findings (4 judgment, 3 mechanical/environmental). Gamma improved from B+ (13 rounds in v3.31.0) to A- (5 rounds). Post-release assessment revised gamma: B+ -> A-. |
| 3.31.0 | A- | A | A | B+ | L7 | Canonical packet transport replaces diff-based inbox materialization (#150). `cn_packet.ml`: envelope schema (`cn.packet.v1`), 9-step validation pipeline, dedup/equivocation index, `refs/cn/msg/{sender}/{msg_id}` namespace. Legacy `materialize_branch` + orphan rejection pipeline fully deleted. Send-side creates root commits under packet refs. 16 ppx_expect tests, 8 cram tests rewritten. 13 review rounds, 22 findings (79% mechanical -- no pre-push test sweep). Silent content swap structurally eliminated. Post-release assessment revised gamma: A -> B+. |
| 3.29.1 | A | A | A | A | L6 | Patch: `resolve_bin_path` uses `Unix.readlink` directly instead of spawning shell child (#148). Fixes false version drift + daemon crash loop on Pi. Release skill updated: §2.5 RELEASE.md format, §3.7 mechanical gate. |
| 3.29.0 | A | A | A | A | L6 | Remove hardcoded paths (#146): `resolve_bin_path` derives binary location at runtime (`$CN_BIN` → `/proc/self/exe` → `readlink Sys.executable_name` → fallback), `resolve_repo` derives GitHub repo from build-time `cn.json` extraction (`$CN_REPO` override). `cn_repo_info.ml` dune-generated module. `cn_deps.ml` default source derived from `Cn_lib.cnos_repo`. 7 ppx_expect tests. 2 review rounds, 5 findings R1 (1B/4C), all addressed R2. Build fails if `cn.json` lacks GitHub URL (no silent fallback). |
| 3.28.0 | A | A | A | A- | L6 | Orphan rejection loop fix (#144): deterministic rejection filenames (`rejection_filename` keyed on peer+branch replaces timestamped `make_thread_filename`), `is_already_rejected` dedup across outbox+sent, `get_branch_author` removed (fetched peer identity authoritative), self-send guard in `send_thread`, `from:` field in rejection envelope. 9 ppx_expect tests. Inbox skill v3: meta-skill alignment (artifact_class, kata_surface, governing_question), Define/Unfold/Rules/Verify structure, two embedded katas, pull-only transport model documented with contrastive examples. 1 review round, 1 D-level finding (stale clone wording), fixed same session. |
| 3.27.1 | A | A | A | A | L5 | Remove cron installation management (#138): `update_cron` and `cn-cron` deleted, docs rewritten (AUTOMATION.md daemon-first, README systemd prerequisite, CLI.md cron label removed). Oneshot mode preserved. CDD traceability normalization: lifecycle step numbers (0–13) replace §2.x in PR template and review skill (#143). 2 PRs, 1 review round on #139 (scope narrowing). |
| 3.27.0 | A- | A | A- | B+ | L6 | CDD traceability + skill-loading bridge: artifact manifest (§5.3), execution trace (§5.4), review enforcement (§2.0.8), release trace update, post-release closeout (§6). Active-skill matrix by work shape × level in eng/README. CDD §2.4 binds level labels to concrete skills. Writing skill rewrite. CAP skill v2 (UIE-based). Meta-skill rewrite (artifact classification, kata surface). 18 commits, 5 skill rewrites, 2 new CDD sections. Process: 3 direct-to-main commits retro-closed via #137; §3.7 added as preventive rule. |
| 3.26.1 | A | A | A | A | L5 | Docs: OPERATOR.md (day-2 operations manual), post-release assessment v3.26.0, CLI/troubleshooting updated for cn logs, hub name sanitization across 19 files (strip deployment-specific agent names from public docs). |
| 3.26.0 | A- | A | A- | B+ | L7 | Unified log stream + cn logs CLI (#74 Phase 1): `cn_ulog.ml` append-only JSONL writer (schema cn.ulog.v1, 5 event kinds), `cn_logs.ml` CLI with --since/--msg/--errors/--json/--kind filters, correlation via msg_id across all entries. Runtime emits at 9 points (message lifecycle + silent drops + poll errors). Chunk-accumulation read path preserves chronological order across day boundaries. 21 tests (13 ulog + 8 logs). 6 review rounds across 2 reviewers — multi-day ordering bug (independent) and silent message drops (Σ) both found and fixed. §2.2.1a extended: new data surfaces require write AND read path verification. |
| 3.25.0 | A | A | A | A- | L7 | Structural self-knowledge interception (#64): `Contract_redirect` as first-class receipt status, `check_self_knowledge_path` interceptor in executor (after sandbox, before I/O), membrane covers all 5 observe surfaces — fs_read (redirect), fs_list child filtering, fs_glob result filtering, git_grep/git_observe exclusions. RC authority declaration references structural enforcement. 10 expect tests. 2 review rounds, 3 D-level membrane holes found R1 (fs_list children, fs_glob, git_grep), all closed R2. Last P0 (#64) closed. |
| 3.24.0 | A | A | A | A- | L7 | Template distribution via package system (#119): templates as 6th content class in package system, `read_template` with Result-typed 3-case resolution (Ok/not-installed/not-found), `run_init` reads from installed cnos.core after `setup_assets`, `run_setup` populates missing spec/ from templates without overwriting operator content. PACKAGE-SYSTEM.md architecture doc (content class taxonomy, pipeline, explicit-vs-generic rationale). 11 new tests (7 build + 4 e2e regression). Unicode hygiene added to review skill/checklist. 1 review round, 1 mechanical finding (stale cross-ref). All 5 ACs met. |
| 3.23.0 | A- | A- | A- | A | L7 | Pre-push gate (#117): `scripts/pre-push.sh` runs dune build, dune runtest, cn build --check, VERSION parity against origin/main. CDD §9.1 cycle iteration with structured template, triggers, cycle level (L5/L6/L7), closure gate, skill patching as immediate output. ENGINEERING-LEVELS.md cross-referenced. #64 P0 closed (all 3 root causes verified). SOUL §2.2 MCA-first on error correction. CDD §4.4 "load means read the file." ORIGIN.md genesis narrative. Squash merge enabled. |
| v3.22.0 | A- | A- | A | A- | L6 | Daemon version-drift detection (#110): `version_drift_check_once` as 8th maintenance primitive, `check_binary_version_drift` detects external binary replacement via `--version` comparison, triggers `re_exec` with shared `is_idle` drain guard. 1 review round, 0% mechanical ratio. All 4 #110 ACs met. |
| v3.20.0 | B+ | A- | A- | B | L6 | Runtime Extensions e2e (#73): host command resolution maps bare manifest names to installed paths, returns Result with existence/permission/traversal validation. Extension dispatch pipeline validated end-to-end with real cnos.net.http host binary. 3 review rounds, 0% mechanical ratio. All 7 #73 ACs met. MCI freeze lifted (8 releases). |
| v3.19.0 | A- | A | A- | B+ | L5 | Package System Substrate AC5-AC7 (#113): integrity hash (md5 tree hash) in lock generation + restore verification, doctor validates full desired→resolved→installed chain (metadata, integrity, stale installs), Runtime Contract package truth expanded with source/rev/integrity. 1 review round, 33% mechanical ratio. #113 AC3-AC7 shipped across v3.18.0+v3.19.0. |
| v3.18.0 | B+ | A- | B+ | B- | L5 | Package System Substrate AC3+AC4 (#113): path-consistent restore (copy_tree replaces 5-category hardcoded list), honest third-party rejection (lockfile_for_manifest returns Result), stale cnos.pm cleanup, package manifests synced with skill reorg. 3 review rounds, 57% mechanical ratio, 1 superseded PR. Partial: AC5-AC8 deferred. |
| v3.17.0 | B+ | A | B+ | C+ | L5 | Runtime Extensions Phase 1 (#73): open op registry replaces closed built-in vocabulary, subprocess host protocol, manifest-driven discovery, extension lifecycle (discovered→compatible→enabled/disabled/rejected), Runtime Contract integration (cognition + body), traceability (extension.* events), doctor health checks, first reference extension cnos.net.http. 5 review rounds, 53% mechanical ratio. Partial: build integration, policy intersection, host binary (Phase 2). TSC corrected by post-release assessment. |
| v3.16.2 | A | A | A | A- | L6 | Two-membrane projection integrity (#106): presentation membrane hardened (shared xml_prefixes, block-level + inline stripping, matched-tag close), self-knowledge membrane (anti-probe in Runtime Contract). 5 review rounds, 12 D-level findings resolved. Configuration mode spec + templates shipped. Review skill converged (§2.1.3 mechanical scan, §2.2.1a input enumeration). |
| v3.16.1 | A | A | A | A | L6 | Daemon retry limit + dead-letter (#28): 4xx fail-fast, exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s), offset advancement after dead-letter. Sustainability surface added. |

| v3.15.2 | A | A | A | A | L6 | Empty Telegram filter (#29), CDD v3.15.0 canonical rewrite (authority split resolved), review skill hardened (4 new checks from PR #103 comparison). |
| v3.15.1 | A | A | A | A- | L6 | Fix #22 review blockers: re-exec after binary update (no stale in-process version), stamp-versions.sh derives manifests from VERSION, cn build --check + cn release gate version consistency, unified truth read in update_runtime. Process: reviewed before merge, CI green. |
| v3.15.0 | A- | A | A- | B+ | L5 | Version coherence (#22): VERSION→dune→cn_version.ml chain is sound (α A). β regressed: I1 CI check failed at merge, claim/reality gap on AC3+AC10. γ regressed: 0 review rounds (self-merged ~26min), merged with red CI, 3 fix commits post-implementation — first release after §11.11 review metrics bypassed review entirely. Manifests not yet stamped from VERSION (validate-only, not derive). Update path uses stale in-process version. Core architecture correct; contract partially closed. |

## 3.73.0 (2026-05-01)

### Changed
- **cdd:** Systematic lifecycle audit and refactor (#325). Explicit coordination model (sequential bounded dispatch), lifecycle state table (S0–S12), role/artifact ownership matrix (§5.3b), α close-out re-dispatch mechanism, δ preflight gate in γ closure, closure verification checklist (10 failure-mode rows), small-change artifact collapse table.
- **cdd/alpha:** Re-dispatch mechanism for close-out writing after β approval.
- **cdd/gamma:** α close-out re-dispatch protocol, δ preflight gate row (row 13), RELEASE.md and artifact move ownership (§2.6).
- **cdd/operator:** Algorithm steps 4–6 for re-dispatch paths, lifecycle table updated.
- **cdd/release, cdd/post-release:** β/δ authority boundary corrected — δ owns tag/release/deploy.

### Fixed
- **release.sh:** Automatic `.cdd/unreleased/` → `.cdd/releases/{version}/` move at release time.
- Moved 10 stale unreleased cycle directories to correct release versions (3.65.0–3.72.0).

## 3.72.0 (2026-05-01)

### Changed
- **skill(cdd/issue):** Split issue skill into focused subskills and add label taxonomy (#324). Root `issue/SKILL.md` rewritten as orchestrator; four subskills added: `labels/`, `contract/`, `proof/`, `constraints/`. Every issue now requires one kind label and one priority label.

### Fixed
- **ci:** Add R5-activate `run.sh` to unblock Tier 2 kata suite.

## 3.71.0 (2026-05-01)

### Changed
- **Kernel/Persona/Operator activation triad** — `cn activate` now emits three layered sections (`## Kernel`, `## Persona`, `## Operator`) replacing the conflated `## Identity` bucket (#321, follows #320)
- **Kernel relocated** — `cnos.core/templates/SOUL.md` moved to `cnos.core/doctrine/KERNEL.md`; per-hub identity slots removed; kernel references `spec/PERSONA.md` and `spec/OPERATOR.md` for per-hub identity (#321)

### Removed
- **`templates` package content class** — removed from `pkg.ContentClasses` and `PACKAGE-SYSTEM.md`; `cnos.core/templates/USER.md` deleted (unused); `cnos.core/templates/` directory deleted (#321)

### Added
- **Three kernel states** — `cn activate` distinguishes `vendored at <path>@<version>` / `dependency manifest declares cnos.core; not restored — run cn deps restore` / `no kernel reference` (#321)
- **Three deps states** — `## Dependencies` distinguishes restored / manifest-only / none (#321)
- **`## Read first` section** — ordered reading path: persona → operator → kernel → deps manifest → latest reflection (#321)
- **Latest reflection pointer** — most recent `threads/reflections/daily/` file path appears in `## Read first` when present (#321)
- **R5 kata P7–P11** — triad split, kernel states, deps states, read-first ordering, reflection pointer (#321)

---

## 3.70.0 (2026-04-30)

### Added
- **`cn activate`** — kernel CLI command that generates a bootstrap prompt from local hub state; stdout-only prompt, stderr diagnostics, no model invocation (#320)

### Changed
- **CTB docs tightened** — v0.2 status truth, §6 reordering, §10.1 type field, §13 bounded fix examples, §15 non-normative hygiene, SEMANTICS-NOTES reading map + epistemic stance (#317)

---

## 3.69.0 (2026-04-30)

### Added
- **Agent activation docs** — README quickstart step 5, OPERATOR.md split into current/target, SETUP-INSTALLER phases (#312, #313, #314, #315)

---

## 3.68.0 (2026-04-30)

### Added
- **CTB TSC grounding** — explicit TSC formal references in SEMANTICS-NOTES.md §15 for tri(), witnesses, composition bound (#297)

---

## 3.67.0 (2026-04-30)

### Added
- **eng/troubleshoot** — live diagnosis skill for environmental and runtime failures (#309)
- **CA conduct reflection** — Reflect section in ca-conduct as core continuity requirement (#84)
- **SOUL.md skill-loading gate** — imperative rule in §2.1 Observation requiring skill loading before action (#149)
- **scripts/release.sh** — single-command release gate (stamp, verify, commit, tag, push)
- **Dispatch failure evidence log** for #295

### Changed
- CDD: δ dispatches all roles sequentially — γ produces prompts, δ executes dispatch
- CDD: β owns merge only; δ owns release boundary (tag/deploy/disconnect)
- eng/troubleshoot: operator review patches (escalation path, flexible triage, sources, corrective action terminology)

---

## 3.56.2 (2026-04-16)

### Fixed

- **`cn deps lock` honors `.cn/deps.json`** (#250, PR #259). Before: `restore.GenerateLockFromIndex` iterated every `(name, version)` pair in the package index, ignoring the manifest entirely. A hub pinning `cnos.core@3.54.0` got a lockfile with every package in the index at every version, and `cn deps restore` over-vendored. After: the generator reads `.cn/deps.json` first, then resolves each pin via `idx.Lookup(name, version)`. Unresolved pins fail with an explicit error listing every missing `name@version`; missing `deps.json` fails with a clear message instead of succeeding with an index dump.

### Added

- **`pkg.ParseManifest([]byte) (*Manifest, error)`** (`src/go/internal/pkg/pkg.go`): pure parser for `.cn/deps.json`. Mirrors the existing `ParseLockfile` / `ParsePackageIndex` shape; no IO.
- **`restore.ReadManifest(path) (*pkg.Manifest, error)`** (`src/go/internal/restore/restore.go`): IO wrapper around `ParseManifest`. Preserves the `eng/go §2.17` `Parse*`/`Read*` purity split.
- **Six AC-named tests** in `restore_test.go`:
  - `TestGenerateLockFromIndex_FiltersByManifest` — AC1 + AC4 (reproducer from #250: 3-package × 2-version index, 1 pin → lockfile len 1).
  - `TestGenerateLockFromIndex_NameAppearsAtMostOnce` — AC2 (3 versions in index, 1 pinned → exactly one entry).
  - `TestGenerateLockFromIndex_RestoreInstallsOnlyPinned` — AC3 (integration with real tarballs: 2 pkgs in index, 1 pinned → only pinned installed).
  - `TestGenerateLockFromIndex_MissingManifest` — no silent fallback when `deps.json` is absent.
  - `TestGenerateLockFromIndex_PinNotInIndex` — unresolved pins error explicitly with the full `name@version`.
  - `TestGenerateLockFromIndex_DefaultProfile` — the two-entry `cn setup` default (`cnos.core` + `cnos.eng`) round-trips through lock without leaking a third `cnos.cdd` from the index.

### Changed

- **`restore.GenerateLockFromIndex`** rewritten (`src/go/internal/restore/restore.go`): reads manifest, iterates `m.Packages`, looks up each pin, collects unresolved pins into a single error message, writes the sorted lockfile. Godoc spells out the new contract and every error case. Output remains sorted by `(name, version)` for deterministic content.
- **CI `kata-tier2` setup** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): now derives `cnos.core` / `cnos.kata` / `cnos.cdd.kata` versions from `src/packages/*/cn.package.json` at job time and writes the canonical array-schema `deps.json`. Previously pinned `cnos.core@3.54.0` (stale) with object-syntax `packages: {name: version}` (the Go and OCaml parsers both reject that shape; the old bug masked the error). The fix mechanically closes both drift paths.
- **Tier-1 kata `scripts/kata/06-install.sh`**: overwrites the `cn setup` default `deps.json` with an explicit pin to the real `cnos.core` version read from `src/packages/cnos.core/cn.package.json`, and tightens the post-condition from "≥ 1 installed" to "exactly `cnos.core` installed" — the over-vendoring regression class is now blocked at CI time.
- **`cnos.kata` `lib.sh` `write_deps_json`** now emits `packages` as an array of `{name, version}` objects. The comment documents why the pre-#250 object-syntax worked "by accident" (lockfile dumped the entire index regardless of parse result).
- **`cnos.kata` `lib.sh` `pkg_version_from_source <pkg> <repo_dist>`** added as a shared helper: reads `src/packages/<pkg>/cn.package.json` and echoes the version. R3 (`doctor-broken`) and R4 (`self-describe`) katas now use it instead of hardcoding `3.54.0`.

### Not in scope (explicit)

- Semver range resolution (`*`, `^`, `~`) — issue #250 defers this; a pin of `*` now errors as "not in index" because `*` is not a real version key.
- Transitive dependency resolution — package manifests do not yet declare a `dependencies` field; when that lands, `GenerateLockFromIndex` will need to walk the graph.
- Schema evolution — `cn.deps.v1` and `cn.lock.v2` unchanged.

### Known debt

- `cn setup` pins `deps.json` to the **binary's** version. In any environment where the binary version is not a real key in the local package index (dev checkouts, CI without `-ldflags`), `cn deps lock` immediately after `cn setup` will now error explicitly. The Tier-1 kata works around this; operators in similar setups can either build the binary with `-X main.version=` or hand-edit `deps.json`. A follow-up to make `cn setup` resolve against the local index is a candidate issue.

---

## 3.54.0 (2026-04-14)

### Added

- **Tier 1 bare-binary kata suite** (#236): six executable scripts at `scripts/kata/0{1..6}-*.sh` proving the `cn` binary works end-to-end before any package is installed — `01-binary` (help listing), `02-init` (hub creation), `03-status` (hub state read), `04-doctor` (clean-hub validation), `05-build` (dist production), `06-install` (package restore). Each script's header comment names exactly what it proves; no overclaiming.
- **`scripts/kata/run-all.sh` stop-on-first-failure** (#236): iterates `[0-9]*.sh` in filename order, exits non-zero on the first failure so CI surfaces the earliest break.
- **CI `kata-tier1` job** (#236): `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the suite on every PR, depends on `go` so it sees the freshly-built binary, and gates merges.
- **Three-tier kata catalog** (`docs/gamma/cdd/KATAS.md`, #236): Tier 1 = bare binary (this release), Tier 2 = runtime/package in `cnos.kata` (#237), Tier 3 = method/CDD in `cnos.cdd.kata`. `scripts/smoke/` remains separate for release-bootstrap compatibility.

### Changed

- **`cn help` always lists the 8 kernel commands** (#236): `cmd_help.go` now emits the Kernel section unconditionally, annotating hub-requiring commands with `(requires hub)` when no hub is discovered. Enables kata 01 to run before `cn init`.
- **`cn doctor` three-way Status** (#236): `internal/doctor/doctor.go` replaces the binary pass/fail with `StatusPass` (✓), `StatusInfo` (○), `StatusFail` (✗). Only `StatusFail` drives the exit code; `HasFailures` checks only `StatusFail`. Fresh-hub pending artifacts (`deps.lock.json`, runtime contract, state/runtime-contract.json, git origin remote, `.cn/vendor/packages/` before any lock) report informationally rather than fatally. `deps.json` after `cn setup` remains fatal when missing. Present-but-invalid artifacts still fail.
- **`cmd_doctor.go` glyph renderer**: three-way glyph selection matches the three-way Status; `cli/` stays a thin wrapper per T-002.

### Removed

- **`Registry.Available()` dead code** (#236): previously gated pre-hub vs post-hub command lists; the always-list help policy makes it unused. Removed to keep the registry accessor surface minimal.
- **`scripts/kata/01-boot.sh`, `02-command.sh`, `03-roundtrip.sh`** (#236): post-package behavior moved to Tier 2 (`cnos.kata`, #237). Old `04-doctor.sh` rewritten as the clean-hub doctor check that Tier 1 actually needs.

---

## 3.52.0 (2026-04-12)

### Added

- **Package command scanning** (#226): `internal/discover/ScanPackageCommands` walks `.cn/vendor/packages/*/cn.package.json`, parses `commands` entries, creates exec-backed `Command` implementations registered into the unified registry.
- **Repo-local command scanning** (#226): `internal/discover/ScanRepoLocalCommands` walks `.cn/commands/cn-*`, creates `Command` from filename convention. Operator overrides at tier 1.
- **External command dispatch** (#226): `ExecCommand.Run()` execs entrypoint scripts with `CN_HUB_PATH`, `CN_PACKAGE_ROOT`, `CN_COMMAND_NAME` environment variables.
- **Tiered help output** (#226): `cn help` groups commands by Kernel / Repo-local / Package with source attribution (`[cnos.core]`).
- **Command integrity validation** (#226): `cn doctor` reports missing entrypoints, non-executable files, and duplicate command names within a tier.
- **Entrypoint path confinement** (#226): manifest entrypoints validated to stay within package directory via `filepath.Rel` — rejects path traversal (`../../`).
- **`FullPackageManifest` type** (#226): pure type in `internal/pkg/` for parsing `cn.package.json` with command entries. Deterministic ordering via `slices.Sort`.
- **13 new tests** (#226): 8 in `discover/`, 5 in `pkg/`.

### Changed

- **`doctor.RunAll` signature** (#226): accepts optional `commandIssues` parameter for command integrity reporting.
- **`DoctorCmd` struct** (#226): receives `Registry` pointer from `main.go` for cross-command validation.

---

## 3.41.0 (2026-04-10)

### Added

- **TypeScript skill** (`eng/typescript`): Converged through 2 iterations. Schema-backed trust boundaries (Zod/Valibot/ArkType), branded primitives for domain scalars (`AbsolutePath`, `Checksum`, `PackageName`), explicit error policy (thrown `Error` vs discriminated results by layer), mutation discipline (`readonly` default, return new values), idempotence/retry/receipts for stateful operations. Two katas (package index client, async command runner). Registered in `cnos.eng`.

### Changed

- **Move 2 slice 4 (final)** (#201, PR #202): Activation frontmatter parser + validation types extracted into `src/lib/cn_frontmatter.ml` — 3 types (`frontmatter`, `issue_kind` 3-variant, `issue`) + 1 constant + 6 parsers + 2 helpers. 21 ppx_expect tests. 1 review round, **zero findings** — first Move 2 cycle with none. §2.5b checks 7+8 validated: the failure classes from slices 2+3 did not recur.
- **Move 2 complete.** `src/lib/` now holds 5 pure modules (cn_json, cn_package, cn_contract, cn_workflow_ir, cn_frontmatter). Every pure type and parser lives in `src/lib/`; every IO function lives in `src/cmd/`. The Go kernel rewrite (#192) has its boundary contract.
- **CDD §1.4 Roles formalized**: Two-agent minimum for substantial cycles. Small-change exception for §1.2-qualifying work. Implementer as optional delegated role. Reviewer is the default releaser (carries independent evaluation into assessment). Merge is part of step 9. Role column added to §5.3 lifecycle table.
- **CDD post-release ownership**: Releasing agent owns steps 11–13. Reviewer-default rationale documented.
- **v3.39.0 + v3.40.0 stacked post-release assessments** (#199, PR #200): Both cycles assessed retroactively. #198 cited as §12a corrective for both.

---

## 3.40.0 (2026-04-09)

### Added

- **Go skill** (`eng/go`): Runtime/kernel Go craft skill converged through 4 iterations. Covers package design, concrete types, consumer-owned interfaces, context flow, error wrapping with `errors.Is`/`errors.As`, resource lifecycles (`defer` discipline), structured observability (`log/slog`), side-effect boundaries (adapter injection), concurrency discipline, testing, build. cnos-specific: schema/compatibility, determinism, idempotence, traceability/receipts, runtime boundaries (commands/orchestrators/extensions/skills), shell/archive safety, override precedence. Two katas (package restore, contract extraction). Registered in `cnos.eng` package.
- **CDD §2.5b checks 7+8** (#198): Check 7 — workspace-global library-name uniqueness (`grep` before new dune stanza). Check 8 — CI green before requesting review (draft-until-green pattern). Rooted in #195 F1 + #197 F1.
- **Telegram CI notifications**: All 3 workflows (ci.yml, coherence.yml, release.yml) notify on success/failure. Graceful skip if secrets not set.

### Changed

- **Move 2 slice 2** (#194, PR #195): Runtime contract types extracted into `src/lib/cn_contract.ml` — 11 types (`package_info`, `override_info`, `zone`, `zone_entry`, `identity`, `extension_contract_info`, `command_entry`, `orchestrator_entry`, `cognition`, `body_contract`, `runtime_contract`) + `zone_to_string` + transitive `activation_entry` via chained re-export. `cn_runtime_contract.ml` re-exports via type-equality. 13 ppx_expect tests. 2 review rounds (F1: library name collision, mechanical).
- **Move 2 slice 3** (#196, PR #197): Workflow IR extracted into `src/lib/cn_workflow_ir.ml` — 6 types (`trigger`, `permissions`, `step` 6-variant, `orchestrator`, `issue_kind` 7-variant, `issue`) + 10 pure functions (parsers, validator, helpers, result combinator). Largest `src/lib/` module (316 lines). Option-(b) principle: `load_outcome`/`installed`/`outcome` stay in `cn_workflow.ml` (no `src/lib/` consumer). `Printf.eprintf` stderr precedent documented in CORE-REFACTOR.md §7. 20 ppx_expect tests. 2 review rounds (F1: expect-test stderr mismatch, mechanical).
- **CORE-REFACTOR.md §7**: Discipline extended — stderr diagnostic logging permitted for discovery-time warnings. Status blocks for v3.39.0 + v3.40.0 appended.
- **`src/lib/`**: Now 4 pure modules (cn_json, cn_package, cn_contract, cn_workflow_ir). Move 2 is 3/4 complete.

### Fixed

- **Go skill package placement**: Moved from `cnos.core` to `cnos.eng` — was causing coherence CI drift check failure.
- **v3.38.0 lag table**: TBD entry replaced with #193 (`llm` step execution).

---

## 3.35.0 (2026-04-07)

### Added

- **Runtime contract activation index** (#173): cognition layer now exposes `activation_index.skills` with declarative triggers parsed from SKILL.md frontmatter. `cn_activation.ml`: frontmatter parser, activation table builder, conflict validator.
- **Command registry in runtime contract** (#173): body layer includes `commands` registry via `Cn_command.discover`.
- **Orchestrator registry in runtime contract** (#173): body layer includes `orchestrators` registry from package manifests.
- **ORCHESTRATORS.md design doc** (#170): four-surface architecture (skills decide, commands dispatch, orchestrators execute, extensions provide capability). CTB as source language, Effect Plan as IR.

### Changed

- **Markdown/JSON parity enforced** (#177, F3): markdown projection of `activation_index` now renders two-level nesting (`activation_index: > skills: > entries`) matching JSON schema shape.
- **Silent error suppression eliminated** (#177, F1/F2/R2): all manifest parse errors, malformed entries, and leaf-value coercions logged with package context in `cn_runtime_contract.ml` and `cn_activation.ml`.
- **#170 dependency graph cleaned**: #172 independent, #173 depends on #170 (not #172), #174 explicitly owns orchestrator package-class.
- **ORCHESTRATORS.md**: ETB replaced with CTB terminology (#172).

### Fixed

- **Retro-review findings** (#177): 5 findings from post-merge retro on PR #176 all addressed — silent orchestrator logging (F1/F2), parity (F3), missing tests (F4), stale bare catch confirmed absent (F5).

### Process

- PR #176 merged without CDD review — process violation corrected via retro-review and findings PR #177. WORKFLOW_AUTO.md created as mechanical gate to prevent recurrence.

## 3.32.0 (2026-04-04)

### Fixed

- **Legacy fallback path audit** (#152): systematic audit of all legacy/fallback/deprecated paths in src/. 29 findings classified in frozen audit table.
  - **Removed (7):** `run_inbound`, `feed_next_input`, `wake_agent` (~160 lines dead code since v3.27), `hub_flat_mindsets_path`, `hub_flat_skills_path` + loader blocks (~25 lines, package namespace only since v3.25).
  - **Converted (15):** all bare `with _ ->` in touched files converted to `Printf.eprintf` warning + fallback. Covers `cn_assets.ml` (9), `cn_deps.ml` (3), `cn_agent.ml` (2), plus 1 narrowed catch.
  - **Kept (7):** `git.ml` main/master fallback, `release_lock` cleanup, `extract_inbound_message` defensive fallback, `resolve_render` traced fallback, `cn_dotenv.ml` optional load, `cn_sandbox.validate_path` (fail-closed). All justified.
  - 5 review rounds, 10 findings (3D in R1, 3D in R2, 2 in R3, 1 in R4, 0 in R5). Net: ~185 lines deleted, ~40 added.

### Added

- **Thread event model design** (#153): `docs/alpha/protocol/THREAD-EVENT-MODEL.md` v1.0.1 — canonical ID (`{id}@{author}`) vs locator split, parent-linked publication, Git-first transport-flexible. Implementation plan: `docs/gamma/cdd/3.32.0/PLAN-thread-event-model.md`.
- **Hub placement models design** (#156): `docs/alpha/HUB-PLACEMENT-MODELS.md` — split `hub_root`/`workspace_root` for sandboxed agents, placement manifest (`.cn/placement.json`), nested clone as default backend, submodule optional. Implementation plan: `docs/gamma/cdd/3.33.0/PLAN-hub-placement-models.md`.

### Changed

- **CDD bundle normalization**: all 7 CDD skill artifacts (`cdd`, `design`, `review`, `release`, `post-release`, `plan`, `issue`) have full frontmatter (`artifact_class`, `kata_surface`, `governing_question`). Descriptions sharpened as "How do we..." process questions. Kata expanded to Scenario/Task/Verification/Common failures. Package copies synced.

---

## 3.29.1 (2026-04-02)

**Fix daemon crash loop from false version drift**

### Fixed

- **`resolve_bin_path` uses `Unix.readlink` directly (#148):** Spawning `readlink -f /proc/self/exe` via `Child_process.exec` ran in a bash child whose `/proc/self/exe` was `/usr/bin/bash`. This caused `check_binary_version_drift` to run `bash --version`, detect false drift ("GNU" ≠ "3.29.0"), and trigger a failing re-exec loop every maintenance cycle. Now uses `Unix.readlink "/proc/self/exe"` in-process.

### Changed

- **Release skill §2.5:** Added RELEASE.md step with format template. CI uses `RELEASE.md` as GitHub release body. §3.7 mechanical gate: no tag without RELEASE.md.

## 3.29.0 (2026-04-02)

**Remove hardcoded paths — runtime bin_path + build-time repo**

### Fixed

- **Hardcoded `bin_path`** replaced with `resolve_bin_path()`: `$CN_BIN` env var → `readlink /proc/self/exe` (Linux) → `readlink Sys.executable_name` (macOS/fallback) → `Sys.executable_name`. Self-update now works for any install prefix where user has write access.
- **Hardcoded `repo`** replaced with `resolve_repo()`: `$CN_REPO` env var → `Cn_lib.cnos_repo` (build-time from `cn.json`).
- **`cn_deps.ml` default source** derived from `Cn_lib.cnos_repo` instead of hardcoded `"usurobor/cnos"`.

### Added

- `cn_repo_info.ml` — dune-generated module extracting repo from `cn.json` at build time. Build fails if no GitHub URL found (no silent fallback).
- `test/cmd/cn_selfpath_test.ml` — 7 ppx_expect tests: env var override precedence, fallback behavior, format validation, derived source, negative space.
- `$CN_BIN` and `$CN_REPO` environment variable overrides for non-standard installations.

### Removed

- All `/usr/local/bin/cn` literals from `src/**/*.ml`.
- Hardcoded `"usurobor/cnos"` from `cn_agent.ml`.

## 3.28.0 (2026-04-02)

**Orphan rejection loop fix + inbox skill v3**

### Fixed

- **Orphan rejection deduplication (#144):** `rejection_filename` produces deterministic names keyed on (peer, branch), replacing `make_thread_filename` which prepended timestamps and caused unbounded rejection spam (~12/hour per orphan). `is_already_rejected` checks both outbox and sent dirs before creating a new rejection.
- **Authoritative sender identity (#144):** Removed `get_branch_author` (git log inference). Rejection messages now use fetched peer identity (`peer_name`) exclusively. Added `from:` field to rejection frontmatter envelope.
- **Self-send guard (#144):** `send_thread` rejects `to == my_name` before peer lookup, emitting `outbox.skip` trace event with `reason_code:"self_send"`.
- **Stale rejection hint wording (#144):** Rejection message updated from clone-based model to current pull-only protocol ("Push `peer/topic` to your own hub repo so the recipient can fetch it").

### Added

- `test/cmd/cn_mail_test.ml` — 9 ppx_expect tests: filename determinism (3), dedup across outbox/sent (4), self-send detection (2), no-timestamp-prefix (1), no-clone-wording regression (1).

### Changed

- **Inbox skill v3:** Rewritten to meta-skill standard — `artifact_class: skill`, `kata_surface: embedded`, `governing_question`. Define/Unfold/Rules/Verify structure. Pull-only transport model with contrastive examples. Two embedded katas (review request triage, rejection loop handling). Visible closing artifact requirement for every message.

### Removed

- `get_branch_author` — dead code after sender identity fix.

## 3.27.1 (2026-04-02)

**Remove cron installation management + CDD trace normalization**

### Removed
- `update_cron` function from `cn_system.ml` — no longer reinstalls OS crontabs on `cn update` (#138)
- `cn-cron` shell script (`src/cli/cn-cron`) (#138)
- Cron installation guidance from AUTOMATION.md, README prerequisites, CLI.md (#138)

### Changed
- AUTOMATION.md rewritten: daemon-first setup, oneshot as secondary manual/scripted mode (#138)
- README prerequisites: `systemd (recommended)` replaces `System cron or systemd` (#138)
- CLI.md: `(cron mode)` label removed from `cn agent` (#138)
- PR template headings: `§2.3`/`§2.4` → `step 4`/`step 5` (#143)
- Review skill §2.0.8: `step §2.4` → `step 5` (#143)

### Known debt
- `Agent.mode.Cron` and `run_cron` naming — could be renamed to `Oneshot`/`run_oneshot`
- `CN_CRON_PERIOD_MIN` env var still read in `cn_agent.ml` (dead code)
- Deprecated `run_inbound`, `wake_agent` functions still exist in `cn_agent.ml`

---

## 3.27.0 (2026-04-01)

**CDD traceability + skill-loading bridge**

### Added
- CDD §5.3 artifact manifest: step-to-evidence binding for all 13 lifecycle steps
- CDD §5.4 CDD Trace: lightweight execution trace format for primary branch artifacts
- CDD §3.7: no direct-to-main without retro-closure (refs canonical §12)
- Review §2.0.8: CDD execution trace verification
- Release §2.9: CDD Trace update row after release
- Post-release §6: CDD Closeout block for steps 11–13
- eng/README: default active-skill matrix by work shape × engineering level
- Design template: optional Engineering Level field + CDD Trace section

### Changed
- CDD §2.4: active skills selected by work shape → level → dominant risk; level labels require concrete skill names
- Release §2.4: CHANGELOG bound to canonical ledger format; writing skill required for release notes
- Writing skill: full rewrite — governing question, stable facts, revision pass, word-level test
- CAP skill: v2 rewrite — UIE-based, frontmatter, failure modes, kata surface
- Meta-skill (skill/): rewrite — artifact classification, domain formula, self-demonstration
- Skills README: normalized to match meta-skill contract

### Fixed
- Process debt: 3 direct-to-main commits retro-closed (#137)

### Assessment
- α: A — five skill surfaces now carry the same trace model
- β: A- — CDD ↔ design ↔ review ↔ release ↔ post-release all cross-reference; some older doc refs (§5 numbering in assessment examples) may drift
- γ: B+ — three commits landed direct-to-main before §3.7 existed; retro-closed via #137 but the gate was skipped

---

## v3.15.2 (2026-03-25)

**Empty Telegram filter (#29), CDD canonical rewrite, review skill hardening**

Three concerns addressed in one release: a runtime bugfix, the CDD authority split, and review skill improvements.

### Fixed

- **Empty Telegram messages filtered before enqueuing (#29)** — photos, stickers, edits have `text=""` and caused Claude API 400 → infinite retry loop (#28). `drain_tg` now checks `String.trim msg.text = ""`, advances offset, emits trace event (`reason_code: empty_content`). Mirrors existing `rejected_user` pattern.

### Changed

- **CDD.md rewritten as canonical algorithm spec (v3.15.0)** — absorbs §0 selection, 14-step lifecycle, cycle-close, operational debt override, and all sections previously carried only by the skill. 12 sections: purpose, scope, inputs, selection function, lifecycle, artifact contract, mechanical/judgment boundary, review, gate, assessment, closure, related docs.
- **CDD SKILL.md rewritten as executable summary** — clean DUR structure, canonical doc governs on disagreement, no authority exception blocks. Delegates to sub-skills.
- **RATIONALE.md created** — companion document: why CDD is closed-loop, artifact-driven, and not fully mechanical. Absorbs the "why" that doesn't belong in spec or skill.
- **README.md rewritten** — self-describing topic bundle with reading order and document map.
- **AGILE-PROCESS.md demoted to reference profile** — explicitly one valid implementation of CDD, not the method itself.
- **Review skill §2.0.5** — CDD artifact contract check: verify required CDD artifacts exist for the change class.
- **Review skill §2.2.8** — authority-surface conflict: when multiple surfaces define the same thing, verify they agree.
- **Review skill §2.3.6** — evidence depth: match evidence depth to claim strength (predicate ≠ integration).
- **Review skill §3.7** — CI/release-gate state: don't issue merge instruction when required checks haven't run.

### Process

- **CDD §0 selection** — #29 selected via §0.6 operational infrastructure debt override.
- **PR #103** — authored by usurobor via Claude Code session, reviewed by Sigma. Reset+cherry-pick after history rewrite (Test→usurobor authorship fix via git filter-repo).
- **Git authorship fixed** — all historical `Test <test@test.local>` commits rewritten to `usurobor <usurobor@gmail.com>` via git filter-repo. Force-pushed.

---

## v3.16.0 (2026-03-25)

**End-to-end self-update (#37), CDD OVERVIEW, AGILE-PROCESS deletion**

### Fixed

- **`cn update` end-to-end self-update (#37)** — three independent failures fixed:
  1. Same-version patch detection via commit hash comparison (`Update_patch` variant, `release_info` record, `get_latest_release()` with `Cn_json` parsing)
  2. ARM binary in CI release matrix (`ubuntu-24.04-arm` → `cn-linux-arm64`)
  3. Release workflow triggers on bare version tags (`[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*`) in addition to `v*`
  4. `target_commitish` validated as hex SHA before patch comparison — branch names like "main" no longer cause false `Update_patch`
- **`cn --version` shows commit hash** — `cn 3.16.0 (abc1234)` for operator diagnostics
- **Cram tests use prefix match** — `version.t` and `cli.t` handle dynamic commit suffix

### Added

- **CDD OVERVIEW.md** — plain-language introduction: what CDD is, why it exists when agents can write code, what one cycle looks like, what stays mechanical vs judgment-bearing
- **CDD §12 retro-packaging rule** — substantial direct-to-main changes must be followed by retro-snapshot + self-coherence + version-history entry
- **Post-release §5 closure evidence** — template now requires explicit immediate/deferred output accounting

### Changed

- **AGILE-PROCESS.md deleted** — CDD §4.1 lifecycle table supersedes the workflow states. P0–P3 priority bands implied by §3 selection function. One less surface to maintain.
- **CDD bundle reading order** — OVERVIEW → CDD → RATIONALE → epoch assessments
- **Review skill output format** — now includes CI state, merge instruction, and finding type column (closes self-contradiction where rules required them but template omitted them)
- **Release skill §2.3** — VERSION-first flow: `echo X.Y.Z > VERSION` → `stamp-versions.sh` → `check-version-consistency.sh`. Old manual locations removed.
- **Live AGILE-PROCESS refs updated** — ARCHITECTURE.md diagram, AUDIT.md inventory

### Process

- **PR #104** — 4 review rounds (3 D-level blockers found and fixed: syntax error, FSM exhaustive match, bare tag trigger, `target_commitish` validation, `cli.t` prefix match). Authored by usurobor via Claude Code, reviewed by Sigma.
- **Git authorship fixed** — all historical `Test <test@test.local>` commits rewritten to `usurobor <usurobor@gmail.com>` via git filter-repo.
- **CDD retro-packaged** — frozen CDD snapshot in `3.15.2/`, self-coherence report for the canonical rewrite.

---

## v3.16.1 (2026-03-25)

**Daemon retry limit and dead-letter (#28)**

### Fixed

- **Daemon retry limit and dead-letter (#28)** — `drain_tg` no longer retries failed triggers forever. Three changes:
  1. Per-trigger retry counter with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s... capped at 30s)
  2. Error classification: 4xx → dead-letter immediately, 5xx/network → retry with backoff
  3. Dead-letter path: advance Telegram offset, emit trace event, clean up stale state files, continue processing

### Added

- **Sustainability surface** — `.github/FUNDING.yml`, `docs/beta/SUSTAINABILITY.md`, README Support section

### Process

- **PR #105** — 2 review rounds. R1: `Fs.remove` → `Fs.unlink` build fix. AC4 (backoff) pushed from "met via poll interval" to real exponential backoff after review feedback.

---

## v3.13.0 (2026-03-24)

**Docs Governance: CDD Pipeline, Self-Coherence, Feature Bundles (#75)**

Development method and documentation governance made explicit and self-enforcing.

### Added

- **CDD §5.1 pipeline table** — 9 steps (0–8), each with explicit deliverable artifacts and locations. Bootstrap-first rule: first diff on a branch must create the version directory with stubs.
- **CDD §7.8 self-coherence report** — new artifact format (`SELF-COHERENCE.md`) in version directories. Records pipeline compliance, triadic assessment, checklist pass, known debt, and reviewer notes.
- **DOCUMENTATION-SYSTEM.md §3 single version lineage** — all docs use cnos release versions. No independent per-document version lineages. Frozen legacy snapshots explicitly allowed to retain historical versions.
- **Feature bundles** — `docs/alpha/agent-runtime/`, `docs/alpha/runtime-extensions/`, `docs/gamma/cdd/` with bundle READMEs, version directories, and frozen snapshots.
- **CDD skill §4.0 bootstrap** — executable skill now requires version-directory creation before any artifacts.
- **CDD skill §4.8 self-coherence** — executable skill now requires self-coherence report before review.

### Changed

- **CDD §7.3 process artifacts** — fixed stale references: `RULES.md` → `docs/gamma/RULES.md`, removed nonexistent `RELEASE.md`, `PLAN.md` → `docs/gamma/plans/`.
- **CDD §5.0 branch naming** — canonical format `{agent}/{issue}-{scope}-{version}`, tooling suffix rule.
- **Placeholder syntax** — governance docs now use `{placeholder}` instead of `<placeholder>` to prevent GitHub markdown stripping.

### Removed

- **CURIOSITY mindset** — removed `packages/cnos.core/mindsets/CURIOSITY.md`.

---

## v3.12.1 (2026-03-23)

**Daemon Boot Log: Configuration Sources (#61)**

Operators no longer have to probe files to understand what the daemon is running.

### Added

- **Boot banner** — daemon prints structured config declaration before "Daemon started" line: version, hub name, profile, model, secrets source, peers.
- **`secret_source` type** in `cn_dotenv.ml` — `Env | File | Missing` with no value payload. Makes secret leakage structurally impossible at the type level.
- **`probe_source`** function — checks where a secret key is configured without returning its value.
- 5 ppx_expect tests for probe_source (env precedence, file fallback, missing, type safety).

---

## v3.12.0 (2026-03-23)

**Wake-up Self-Model Contract (#56) + CDD/Review Skill Hardening (#57)**

The agent now receives a first-class Runtime Contract at every wake, replacing the overloaded capabilities-only block. Development skills hardened with issue AC reconciliation gates.

### Added

- **cn_runtime_contract.ml** — new module: gather/render_markdown/to_json/write. Structured Runtime Contract with three sub-blocks: self_model (version, hub, packages, overrides), workspace (directories, writable/protected), capabilities (observe/effect ABI, budgets, config).
- **RUNTIME-CONTRACT-v3.10.0.md** — design doc for wake-up self-model contract.
- **COGNITIVE-SUBSTRATE §6.1** — Runtime Contract as normative required runtime-generated block with invariant: agent answers self-knowledge from packed context alone.
- **cn doctor** validates runtime contract (self_model + workspace + capabilities + agent/ existence).
- **cn setup/init** creates `agent/` override directory.
- **CDD skill §2.4** — reconcile coherence contract with issue ACs.
- **CDD skill §4.5.1-3** — AC self-check at commit, multi-format parity rule, build-sync rule.
- **CDD skill §8.5** — author pre-flight AC walk before requesting review.
- **CDD skill §9.1** — issue AC verification as outermost release gate.
- **Review skill §2.0** — walk issue ACs before reading the diff.
- **Review skill §2.2.3** — multi-format parity check for dual-serialization modules.
- 10 new ppx_expect tests for runtime contract.

### Changed

- **cn_capabilities.ml** — `max_passes` now reads from `shell_config.max_passes` instead of hardcoded 2.
- **cn_context.ml** — emits `## Runtime Contract` with three sub-blocks instead of bare `Cn_capabilities.render`.
- **state/runtime-contract.json** — persisted at pack time for operator inspection; JSON now at full parity with markdown (observe/effect/apply_mode/exec_enabled/max_passes/budgets).
- Protected paths derived from `Cn_sandbox.default_denylist` + `protected_files` (single source of truth).

### Fixed

- Package/source sync for agent-ops (N-pass vocabulary) and release skill.

---

## v3.11.0 (2026-03-22)

**N-pass Merge + Misplaced Ops Correction (#51)**

### Added

- **Misplaced ops detection** — detect ops in body text and retry via correction pass (#51).
- **N-pass bind loop merged** to main with review fixes.

### Changed

- Structured output contract (#52) reverted — needs rework for tool_use integration.

---

## v3.10.0 (2026-03-22)

**N-pass Bind Loop (#50)**

### Added

- **Generic N-pass bind loop** — effect pass no longer terminal; loop continues up to `max_passes` as long as there are typed ops.
- **Processing indicators** — agent sees pass labels in context.
- Renamed `two_pass` → `n_pass` across codebase.
- Renamed `run_observe_pass` → `run_pass`.
- Removed observe-centered vocabulary residue.
- Aligned stop reasons and trace reason codes.

---

## v3.9.3 (2026-03-21)

**Anti-Confabulation: Op Result Integrity (#49)**

(Previously: v3.9.1 entry below was mislabeled)

---

## v3.9.1 (2026-03-21)

**Anti-Confabulation: Op Result Integrity (#49)**

Agent no longer confabulates when ops fail or are denied. Explicit result signals in Pass B repack, anti-fabrication instructions in capabilities block and doctrine.

### Added

- **Receipt result signals** — `receipts_summary` now tags each receipt with `[EMPTY_RESULT]`, `[NOT_EXECUTED]`, or `[FAILED]` to distinguish "op succeeded with empty data" from "op was not executed." Pass B context carries these signals so the agent knows what actually happened.
- **Failure WARNING banner** — When any Pass A receipt has status denied or error, the repack includes a `WARNING` block instructing the agent not to fabricate results.
- **Anti-confabulation CRITICAL** in capabilities block — New runtime-generated instruction: "When an op returns status=denied, status=error, or status=ok with zero artifacts, you MUST report the actual result to the user."
- **Op Result Integrity doctrine** — New section in AGENT-OPS.md (both `packages/cnos.core/doctrine/` and `src/agent/doctrine/`) with non-negotiable anti-confabulation rules.
- **6 new orchestrator tests** — `receipts_summary` signal tags for ok/empty/denied/error/skipped/mixed scenarios.

### Changed

- **`receipts_summary` format** — Denial reasons now prefixed with `reason:` for clarity. Each receipt line includes an explicit result signal tag.
- **Capabilities block** — All configs now emit the anti-confabulation CRITICAL line after the ops-in-frontmatter CRITICAL line.

## v3.9.0 (2026-03-20)

**Two-Pass Wiring + Cognitive Substrate + DUR Skill Contract**

Runtime two-pass execution wired end-to-end. COGNITIVE-SUBSTRATE spec published. Three skills cohered to DUR contract. Glossary updated.

### Added

- **Two-pass execution wired** (#41) — `Cn_orchestrator.run_two_pass` coordinates Pass A → repack → LLM call → parse → Pass B → coordination gating. `finalize` accepts `?packed` for Pass B LLM re-call. 7 integration tests with mock LLM.
- **COGNITIVE-SUBSTRATE.md** v1.0.0 — canonical classes (Identity, Doctrine, Mindset, Skill, Reflection), distinction rule, placement algorithm, file contracts, promotion/splitting rules, validation checks.
- **DUR glossary entry** — Define/Unfold/Rules documented as canonical skill contract in GLOSSARY.md.
- **`cn_runtime_integration_test.ml`** — new integration test file for two-pass orchestration.
- **`issue-41-pass-b-wiring.md`** — design doc for two-pass wiring.

### Changed

- **Reflect skill** — cohered to DUR contract. Evidence/Interpretation/Conclusion remapped to Define/Unfold/Rules. Axes (α/β/γ) moved under Unfold. Cadence table under Rules.
- **Adhoc-thread skill** — cohered to DUR contract. Added trigger recognition, type-matching judgment, bias-toward-capture rule.
- **Review skill** — cohered to DUR contract with MCI from PR #32 review process.
- **§7.2 mindset contract** — relaxed to structurally flexible, semantically constrained.

### Fixed

- Integration test pattern match updated for `pass_b_output` field.

---

## v3.8.0 (2026-03-20)

**Syscall Surface Coherence Amendment**

The CN Shell ABI is now honest, orthogonal, and hardened. Four incoherences closed: advertised-but-stub ops, implicit compound behavior, lossy observation, and hidden external dependencies. Multi-round review-driven development (PR #32).

### Added

- **fs_glob** — real implementation replacing stub. Pure OCaml glob matching (*, **, ?), sandbox-validated, symlink cycle detection via realpath, bounded output.
- **git_stage** — explicit staging op. Two modes: named files (sandbox-validated per file, directory rejection, `--literal-pathspecs`) or stage-all (NUL-delimited porcelain parser, per-candidate `validate_path`). Separates staging from commit.
- **fs_read chunking** — `offset` and `limit` fields for bounded reads of large files. Budget-capped.
- **cn doctor** — now checks for `patch(1)` (required by fs_patch).
- **Observe exclusion symmetry** — all four git observe ops (status, diff, log, grep) now use shared `git_observe_exclusions` (`-- . :!.cn :!state :!logs`). Runtime-owned paths hidden from agent.
- **SYSCALL-SURFACE-v3.8.0.md** — design doc specifying all four fixes.
- **PLAN-v3.8.0-syscall-surface.md** — implementation plan.

### Changed

- **git_commit** — no longer does implicit `git add -A`. Commits current index only. Returns `Skipped/nothing_staged` when index is empty. Use `git_stage` before `git_commit`.
- **git_grep** — uses `:(literal)` per-path instead of global `GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS`, appends observe exclusion pathspecs. Uses `-e` to force query as pattern.
- **git_diff / git_log** — `validate_rev` rejects leading-dash revisions (prevents CLI injection).
- **Observe vs write exclusions split** — protected files (SOUL.md, USER.md, etc.) are readable by git observe ops but not stageable by git_stage.

### Security

- `--literal-pathspecs` on git_stage prevents glob/pathspec magic interpretation
- `validate_rev` blocks `--output=<file>` style injection via leading-dash revisions
- `fs_glob` validates paths before descending, prevents symlink attacks
- `git_stage` stage-all rejects directories and symlinks to protected files

### Tests

- 32 → 69+ ppx_expect tests in cn_executor_test.ml
- Regression pairs for each hardening: positive case (feature works) + negative case (incoherence blocked)
- Capstone: git_status shows src/ changes while hiding .cn/, state/, logs/; prior observe op artifacts don't pollute subsequent git_status

### Coherence Delta

- **Gap:** Four ABI incoherences — stub op, compound behavior, lossy reads, hidden dependency
- **Mode:** MCA — change the runtime surface
- **α:** Syscall ABI now honest and orthogonal — no advertised-but-unimplemented ops
- **β:** All git observe ops use same exclusion boundary; capabilities block matches executor behavior
- **γ:** git_stage/git_commit separation enables future fine-grained staging without special cases

---

## v3.7.1 (unreleased)

**Trace Gap Closure: Full Behavioral Reconstruction**

The trace system now captures everything needed to reconstruct agent behavior without external assumptions.

### Fixed

- **LLM call latency + model** — `llm.call.ok` and `llm.call.error` now include `model`, `latency_ms`. Success events already had `input_tokens`/`output_tokens`/`stop_reason`; error events now get `model` and timing too.
- **Drain trigger_ids** — `drain.complete`/`drain.stopped` include `trigger_ids` array showing exactly which items were processed, plus `duration_ms`.
- **Sync duration** — `sync.ok` and `sync.error` include `duration_ms`. Error events include structured `step` and `exit_code` fields.
- **Config snapshot at boot** — `config.loaded` expanded with `max_tokens`, `sync_interval_sec`, `review_interval_sec`, `oneshot_drain_limit`, `daemon_drain_limit`, `telegram_configured`, `allowed_users` count.
- **Poll heartbeat** — `daemon.heartbeat` (Debug) emits every 60s with `polls_since_last` and `uptime_sec`. Hours of silence now distinguishable from dead daemon.
- **Cleanup trace** — `cleanup_once` emits `cleanup.complete` with status=Ok_ (removed count), Skipped (nothing_to_clean), or Degraded (cleanup_failed). No more silent success.

---

## v3.6.0 (unreleased)

### Fixed

- **Two-pass execution wired in cn_runtime (Issue #41)** — `finalize` now invokes Pass B when `needs_pass_b=true`. Previously, observe ops executed but the LLM was never re-called with evidence, making the sense→act loop dead. New `Cn_orchestrator.run_two_pass` coordinates: Pass A → repack with artifacts/receipts → LLM re-call → Parse → Pass B → coordination gating. Pass-A-safe coordination ops (ack, surface, reply) execute during Pass A; terminal ops (done, fail, send, delegate) defer to Pass B and are gated on effect success. Projection and conversation history use the final (Pass B) output. 7 integration tests added.

- **`cn update` binary-only (Issue #27)** — `cn update` now exclusively downloads pre-built binaries from GitHub Releases, mirroring `install.sh`. Removed the git-based update path entirely: no more `/usr/local/lib/cnos` assumption, no `opam exec -- dune build`, no `has_git_install()` detection. One install method, one update method. `Update_git` variant removed from `update_info` type; replaced by `Update_available`. Self-update check at CLI startup uses the same binary-download path.

---

## v3.5.1 (2026-03-11)

**TRACEABILITY: Structured Observability + CDD**

Operators can now answer "did it boot? what did it load? why did it transition?" from files alone.

### Added

- **`cn_trace.ml`** — Append-only JSONL event stream (`logs/events/YYYYMMDD.jsonl`). Schema `cn.events.v1` with boot_id, monotonic seq, severity, layer (sensor/body/mind/governance/world), reason_code on every transition.
- **`cn_trace_state.ml`** — State projections: `state/ready.json` (mind/body/sensors), `state/runtime.json` (cycle/lock/pass), `state/coherence.json` (structural checks).
- **Boot telemetry** — Mandatory 9-event boot sequence: `boot.start` → `config.loaded` → `deps.lock.loaded` → `assets.validated` → `doctrine.loaded` → `mindsets.loaded` → `skills.indexed` → `capabilities.rendered` → `boot.ready`. Per-package skill counts and hub-override detection.
- **Cycle telemetry** — `cycle.start`/`cycle.recover` → `pack.start`/`pack.complete` → `llm.call.start`/`llm.call.ok` → `effects.execute.start`/`effects.execute.complete` → `projection.*` → `finalize.complete`.
- **Sensor telemetry** — `daemon.poll.*`, `daemon.offset.advanced`/`daemon.offset.blocked` with reason codes (`rejected_user`, `still_queued`, `still_in_flight`, `processing_failed`).
- **Governance events** — `pass.selected`, `ops.classified`, `policy.denied` from orchestrator with reason codes.
- **`Cn_hub.log_action` shim** — Resurrected as compatibility bridge to `Cn_trace.gemit`.
- **`Cn_agent.queue_depth`** — Real queue count in projections.
- **`docs/alpha/security/TRACEABILITY.md`** — Full observability spec (721 lines).
- **`docs/gamma/plans/TRACEABILITY-implementation-plan.md`** — 12-step implementation plan.
- **`docs/gamma/CDD.md`** — Coherence-Driven Development v1.1.0: development method applying CAP to the development process.
- **Doc graph updates** — TRACEABILITY wired into README.md, AGENT-RUNTIME.md updated to v3.3.7.

### Fixed

- **Trace test isolation** — `open Cn_cmd` invalid with `wrapped false`; tmp dir collisions from unseeded `Random.int`.
- **Lockfile `ls-remote` parse** — Stricter: `None -> ""` on malformed output.

---

## v3.5.0 (2026-03-10)

**Unified Package Model + Coherent Agent Architecture + FOUNDATIONS**

Everything cognitive is now a package. Three packages ship: `cnos.core` (doctrine + mindsets + agent skills), `cnos.eng` (engineering skills), `cnos.pm` (PM skills). Role profiles select which packages an agent loads.

### Added

- **Unified package model** — `packages/` directory with `cn.package.json` manifests; two-layer resolution (installed packages → hub-local overrides); replaces the three-layer core/packages/hub-local split from v3.4.0
- **`cnos.core` package** — doctrine (FOUNDATIONS, CAP, CBP, CA-Conduct, COHERENCE, AGENT-OPS) + all mindsets + agent/ops/documenting/testing/release/skill skills
- **`cnos.eng` package** — engineering skills (coding, design, functional, OCaml, RCA, review, ship, testing, tool-writing, UX-CLI)
- **`cnos.pm` package** — PM skills (follow-up, issue, ship)
- **Role profiles** — `profiles/engineer.json`, `profiles/pm.json` — select packages per role
- **CAA v1.0.0** (`docs/alpha/agent-runtime/CAA.md`) — Coherent Agent Architecture spec: structural definition of a coherent agent, 7 invariants, failure mode table, wake-up strata
- **FOUNDATIONS.md** (`docs/explanation/`, `packages/cnos.core/doctrine/`) — doctrinal capstone: first principle through runtime, four doctrinal layers, cognitive loop, hierarchy of guidance
- **Doc graph cleanup** — version numbers removed from design doc filenames (AGENT-RUNTIME-v3.md → AGENT-RUNTIME.md, CAR-v3.4.md → CAR.md, PLAN-v3.3.md → PLAN.md)

### Changed

- **`cn_assets.ml`** — rewritten for unified two-layer resolution (was three-layer)
- **`cn_deps.ml`** — updated for package-based materialization
- **`cn_context.ml`** — delegates to `Cn_assets` for doctrine/mindset/skill loading
- **`cn_system.ml`** — updated for package-aware `cn setup` and `cn init`
- **`AGENTS.md`** — removed template-repo assumption; updated for package model
- **`README.md`** — corrected env var names, removed template-repo references

### Removed

- **`docs/design/CAR-v3.4.md`** — superseded by `docs/alpha/cognitive-substrate/CAR.md` (unified model)
- Template-repo assumption throughout docs

---

## v3.4.0 (2026-03-09)

**Cognitive Asset Resolver & Package System**

Fresh hubs now wake with the full cognitive substrate — mindsets, skills, and agent-ops guidance — without needing a separate template repo checkout.

### Added

- **`cn_assets.ml`** — Three-layer asset resolver (core → packages → hub-local overrides). Deterministic loading order, keyword-matched skill scoring delegates here
- **`cn_deps.ml`** — Dependency manifest (`.cn/deps.json`), lockfile (`.cn/deps.lock.json`), materialize/restore pipeline. Git-native package distribution
- **`cn deps` CLI commands** — `list`, `restore`, `doctor`, `add`, `remove`, `update`, `vendor`
- **Cognitive Assets block** in capabilities — agent sees asset summary (core count, packages, overrides) on every wake-up
- **`cn doctor`** checks for `.cn/vendor/core/`, deps manifest, and lockfile
- **`cn setup`** and `cn init` now materialize cognitive assets automatically — hub is wake-ready out of the box
- **CAR design doc** (`docs/design/CAR-v3.4.md`) — problem statement, three-layer model, package format, resolution spec
- **Implementation plan** (`docs/gamma/plans/CAR-implementation-plan.md`) — 8 ordered steps

### Changed

- **`cn_context.ml`** — delegates mindset/skill loading to `Cn_assets`; fails fast if core assets missing
- **`cn_capabilities.ml`** — `render` accepts optional `~assets` summary
- **`cn setup`** no longer requires root — focuses on hub asset materialization (system-level setup moves to `--system`)

### Removed

- Inline `load_mindsets` and skill-walking code from `cn_context.ml` (moved to `cn_assets.ml`)

---

## v3.3.1 (2026-03-07)

**Agent Instruction Alignment**

Fixes Pi hallucinating XML-style tool syntax (`<observe><fs_read>...`) by ensuring the agent sees the correct `ops:` JSON format on every call.

### Added

- **Canonical ops examples in capabilities block** — `cn_capabilities.ml` now injects `syntax:`, `example_observe:`, and `example_effect:` lines so the model sees the exact frontmatter JSON format on every wake-up
- **Output Discipline section** in `AGENTS.md` — explicit ban on XML pseudo-tools, markdown tool-call blocks, and ad-hoc shell snippets
- **Typed Capability Ops section** in `agent-ops/SKILL.md` — full JSON examples for observe, effect, and two-pass patterns with "do not" list

### Fixed

- **Stale paths** in `AGENTS.md` — `skills/` → `src/agent/skills/`, `mindsets/` → `src/agent/mindsets/`, `mindsets/OPERATIONS.md` → `src/agent/mindsets/OPERATIONS.md`
- **Session contract** in `AGENTS.md` — split into runtime mode (context pre-packed, don't re-read) vs manual/debugging mode

### Changed

- **Capabilities block** conditionally omits `example_effect:` when `apply_mode=off` (observe-only)
- All capabilities tests updated for new example lines

---

## v3.3.0 (2026-03-06)

**CN Shell — Typed Ops, Two-Pass Execution, Path Sandbox**

The agent can now read files, inspect git state, write patches, and run allowlisted commands — all as governed, post-call typed ops with receipts and artifact hashing. The pure-pipe boundary is preserved: no in-call tools, no tool loop. Ops are proposed in output.md, validated by cn, and executed with full audit trail.

### Added

- **cn_shell.ml** — Typed op vocabulary (7 observe + 5 effect kinds) + manifest parser with phase validation, auto-assigned op_ids, and duplicate detection
- **cn_sandbox.ml** — Path sandbox: normalization, `..` collapse, symlink resolution via `realpath`, denylist on resolved canonical paths, protected file enforcement. Catches symlinked-parent bypass attacks
- **cn_executor.ml** — Op dispatcher for fs_read/list, git_status/diff/log/grep, fs_write/patch, git_branch/commit, exec (allowlisted + env-scrubbed). Produces receipts and SHA-256-hashed artifacts
- **cn_orchestrator.ml** — Two-pass execution engine: Pass A executes observe ops and defers effects; Pass B executes effects and denies new observe ops. Coordination op gating (terminal ops blocked on effect failure). Context repack with bounded receipts + artifact excerpts for Pass B
- **cn_projection.ml** — Idempotent projection markers using `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` for crash-recovery deduplication of outbound messages
- **cn_capabilities.ml** — Runtime capability discovery block injected into packed context so the agent knows what ops are available before proposing them
- **cn_dotenv.ml** — `.cn/secrets.env` loader with env-var-first resolution and `0600` permission enforcement
- **cn_sha256.ml** — Pure OCaml SHA-256 (FIPS 180-4), zero external dependencies
- **Telegram UX** — 🤔 reaction on inbound message + typing indicator; reaction cleared on success. Uses `request_once` (no retry, 3s cap) for cosmetic calls
- **Crash recovery** — `ops_done` checkpoint prevents duplicate side effects on retry; projection markers prevent duplicate Telegram sends; conversation dedup by trigger_id; ordered cleanup (state files before markers) for crash safety
- **175+ new tests** — ppx_expect tests across all new modules: dotenv (18), shell (28), sandbox (30), executor (28), orchestrator (29), projection (16), capabilities (12), SHA-256 (10)

### Changed

- **cn_config.ml** — Loads CN Shell settings from `.cn/config.json` runtime section: `two_pass`, `apply_mode`, `exec_enabled`, `exec_allowlist`, budgets
- **cn_context.ml** — Optional `~shell_config` parameter injects capabilities block into packed context
- **cn_runtime.ml** — Passes `shell_config` through pack and recovery paths; stale `ops_done` GC on idle State 3 entry

### Docs

- **AGENT-RUNTIME.md** — Appendix C with 6 normative worked examples (v3.3.6)
- **PLAN.md** — 7-step implementation plan (all steps complete)
- **README, ARCHITECTURE, CLI, AUTOMATION** — Updated for new modules and hub structure
- **BUILD-RELEASE.md** — Accurate 7-step release process with RELEASE.md support

### CI

- **ci.yml** — `TMPDIR` isolation + `-j 1` for ppx_expect temp file race
- **release.yml** — Same TMPDIR fix + conditional `RELEASE.md` body for GitHub Releases

---

## v3.2.0 (2026-03-04)

**Structured LLM Request Schema**

The LLM now receives a structured prompt instead of a flat string. This unlocks prompt caching, proper system prompts, and real multi-turn conversation.

### The Big Picture

```
Before (v3.0):  { messages: [{ role: "user", content: "<everything>" }] }
After  (v3.2):  { system: [stable_block, dynamic_block], messages: [turn, turn, ...] }
```

### Added

- **Structured system prompt** — Two system blocks: (1) stable identity/user/mindsets with `cache_control` for Anthropic prompt caching (~90% cache hits on repeat calls), (2) dynamic reflections/skills (refreshed each call)
- **Real multi-turn messages** — Conversation history as actual `user`/`assistant` turns instead of markdown rendered inside a single user message
- **`system_block` / `message_turn` types** in `cn_llm.ml` with manual `to_json` helpers (zero-dep, no ppx)
- **`packed` type** in `cn_context.ml` — returns structured data + `audit_text` for backward-compatible `input.md` logging
- **Design doc** — `docs/DESIGN-LLM-SCHEMA.md` covers problem, schema, OCaml serialization decision, and all tradeoffs
- **Mindsets in context packer** (v3.1.x) — `src/agent/mindsets/` loaded in deterministic order between USER and reflections
- **Role-weighted skill scoring** (v3.1.x) — `runtime.role` from `.cn/config.json` applies +2 bonus to matching skill paths
- **Setup installer design doc** — `docs/alpha/cli/SETUP-INSTALLER.md`: guided `cn setup` flow with Telegram auto-detection, persona picker, secrets management
- **UX-CLI terminal conventions** — Color-to-semantics map, `NO_COLOR` support, actionable error messages
- **New skills** — `agent/coherent`, `eng/coding`, `eng/functional`, `eng/testing`

### Changed

- `Cn_llm.call` signature: `~content:string` → `~system:system_block list ~messages:message_turn list`
- `Cn_context.pack` returns `packed` record (system blocks + messages + audit_text) instead of flat `content` string
- `Cn_runtime.ml` passes structured data to LLM; recovery path (State 2) re-packs from extracted inbound message
- Tests updated to use `packed.audit_text` instead of `packed.content`

### Fixed

- `Filename.temp_dir` replaced with OCaml 4.14-compatible helper
- `runtime.role` normalized to lowercase (tolerates "Engineer", "PM", etc.)
- Expect test promotion: tokenize order + JSON error messages

---

## v3.0.0 (2026-02-22)

**Native Agent Runtime**

cnos agents now run natively — no external orchestrator required. The runtime implements a pure-pipe architecture: the LLM is a stateless `string → string` function, `cn` handles all I/O, effects, and coordination. OpenClaw is fully removed.

### The Big Picture

```
Before (v2.x):  Telegram → OpenClaw → cn → agent ops
After  (v3.0):  Telegram → cn agent → Claude API → cn → agent ops
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                           All native OCaml, ~1,500 lines
```

The agent runtime replaces OpenClaw's:
- Telegram bot infrastructure → `cn_telegram.ml`
- LLM orchestration → `cn_llm.ml` (single call, no tool loop)
- Context management → `cn_context.ml` (pack everything upfront)
- Session handling → `cn_runtime.ml` (orchestrator)

### Added

**6 new modules (~1,500 lines total):**

| Module | Lines | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `cn_runtime.ml` | 557 | Orchestrator: pack → call LLM → write → archive → execute → project |
| `cn_json.ml` | 310 | Zero-dependency JSON parser/emitter |
| `cn_context.ml` | 177 | Context packer (SOUL, USER, skills, conversation, message) |
| `cn_telegram.ml` | 170 | Telegram Bot API client (long-poll + send) |
| `cn_llm.ml` | 154 | Claude Messages API client (single request/response) |
| `cn_config.ml` | 88 | Environment + config.json loader |

**CLI interface:**
- `cn agent` — Cron entry point (dequeue, pack, call LLM, execute ops)
- `cn agent --daemon` — Long-running Telegram polling loop
- `cn agent --stdio` — Interactive testing mode
- `cn agent --process` — Process one queued item directly

**Documentation:**
- `AGENT-RUNTIME.md` — Full design doc with rationale, architecture, migration plan
- Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CLI.md`, `AUTOMATION.md`

### Architecture: Pure Pipe

The core insight: LLMs don't need tools if you pack context upfront.

```
cn packs context → LLM plans → cn executes ops
```

**Context stuffing vs. tool loops:**

| Approach | Token cost | API calls | Latency |
|----------|------------|-----------|---------|
| Tool loop (3 retrievals) | ~15K+ | 3-5 | 3-10s |
| Context stuffing | ~6.5K | **1** | **1-3s** |

For cnos's bounded, predictable context (~20-30 hub files), stuffing wins.

**What gets packed into `state/input.md`:**
- `spec/SOUL.md` — Agent identity (~500 tokens)
- `spec/USER.md` — User context (~300 tokens)
- Last 3 daily reflections (~1,500 tokens)
- Matched skills, top 3 (~1,500 tokens)
- Conversation history, last 10 (~2,000 tokens)
- Inbound message (~200 tokens)

### Changed

- **Removed OpenClaw dependency** — No external orchestrator
- **System deps only** — Requires `git` + `curl`, no opam runtime deps
- **Config location** — `.cn/config.json` (reuses existing hub discovery)
- **Secrets via env vars** — `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_KEY`, `CN_MODEL`

### Security Model (Preserved)

The CN security invariant is enforced:

> Agent interface: `state/input.md → state/output.md`  
> LLM reality: sees text in, produces text out. cn does all effects.

- LLM never touches files, commands, or network
- Ops parsed from output.md frontmatter, validated before execution
- Raw IO pairs archived before effects (crash-safe audit trail)
- API keys via env vars, never logged

### Breaking Changes

- **OpenClaw no longer required** — Remove OC config after migration
- **`cn agent` is the new entry point** — Replaces OC heartbeat/cron
- **Telegram handled natively** — OC bot infrastructure bypassed

### Migration

1. Set env vars: `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_KEY`
2. Create `.cn/config.json` with `allowed_users`
3. Start daemon: `cn agent --daemon` (or systemd unit)
4. Add cron: `* * * * * cn agent` (processes queue)
5. Disable OpenClaw after verification

Rollback: `systemctl stop cn-<name> && systemctl start <previous-service>`

### Technical Highlights

- **Zero opam runtime deps** — stdlib + Unix only
- **curl-backed HTTP** — No OCaml HTTP stack complexity
- **Body consumption rules** — Markdown body = full response, frontmatter = notification
- **FSM integration** — Reuses existing `cn_protocol.ml` actor FSM
- **617 lines of new tests** — `cn_cmd_test.ml` + `cn_json_test.ml`

---

## v2.4.0 (2026-02-11)

**Typed FSM Protocol**

The cn protocol is now modeled as four typed finite state machines with compile-time safety.

### Added
- **4 typed FSMs** — Transport Sender, Transport Receiver, Thread Lifecycle, Actor Loop
- **cn_protocol.ml** — unified protocol implementation replacing scattered logic
- **385 lines of protocol tests** — ppx_expect exhaustive transition testing
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — system overview documentation
- **PROTOCOL.md** — FSM specifications with ASCII diagrams
- **AUDIT.md** — design audit methodology

### Changed
- Archived 7 superseded design docs to `docs/design/_archive/`
- Unified `cn_io.ml` + `cn_mail.ml` transport logic into single FSM

### Fixed
- Invalid state transitions now caught at compile time, not runtime

---

## v2.3.1 (2026-02-11)

**Branch Cleanup Fix**

### Fixed
- Delete local branches after inbox sync (MCA cleanup)
- Skip self-update check if install dir missing
- CI: add ppx_expect to opam deps

---

## v2.3.0 (2026-02-11)

**Native OCaml Binary**

cn is now a native binary — no Node.js required.

### Added
- **Native OCaml build** — `dune build` produces standalone binary
- **Release workflow** — pre-built binaries for Linux/macOS
- **10-module refactor** — cn.ml split into focused modules:
  - `cn_agent.ml`, `cn_commands.ml`, `cn_ffi.ml`, `cn_fmt.ml`
  - `cn_gtd.ml`, `cn_hub.ml`, `cn_mail.ml`, `cn_mca.ml`
  - `cn_protocol.ml`, `cn_system.ml`

### Changed
- `cn update` now copies `bin/*` to `/usr/local/bin/` (2.2.28 backport)
- `cn-cron` now runs `cn in` after sync to wake agent (2.2.27 backport)

### Fixed
- Filter inbound to `threads/in/` only (2.2.26 backport)
- Native argv handling (drops 1, not 2 like Node.js)

---

## v2.2.0 (2026-02-07)

**First Hash Consensus**

Two AI agents achieved verified hash consensus via git-CN protocol — the actor model is complete.

### Milestone
- **Hash consensus** — Pi and Sigma independently converged on cnos `d1cb82c`
- **Verified via git** — runtime.md pushed to GitHub, human-verified
- **No central coordinator** — pure git-based decentralized coordination

### Added
- **cn update auto-commit** — runtime.md auto-commits and pushes (P1)
- **Output auto-reply** — output.md responses auto-flow to sender (CLP accepted)
- **MCA injection** — coherence check every 5th cycle
- **Sync dedup** — checks `_archived/` before materializing
- **agent-ops skill** — operational procedures for CN agents
- **CREDITS.md** — lineage acknowledgment

### Fixed
- Wake mechanism: `openclaw system event` instead of curl
- Version string sync between package.json and cn_lib.ml
- Stale branch cleanup procedures

### Protocol
- 5-minute cron interval standardized
- input.md/output.md protocol documented in SYSTEM.md
- Queue system (state/queue/) for ordered processing

---

## v2.0.0 (2026-02-05)

**Everything Through cn**

Paradigm shift: agents no longer run git directly. Everything goes through the `cn` CLI.

### Added
- **CN CLI v0.1** — `tools/src/cn/`: modular OCaml implementation
  - `cn init`, `cn status`, `cn inbox`, `cn peer`, `cn doctor`
  - Best-in-class patterns from npm, git, gh, cargo
- **UX-CLI spec** — `skills/ux-cli/SKILL.md`: terminal UX standard
  - Semantic color channels
  - Failure-first design
  - "No blame, no vibes"
- **SYSTEM.md** — `spec/SYSTEM.md`: definitive system specification
- **cn_actions library** — Unix-style atomic primitives
- **Coordination First** principle — unblock others before your own loop
- **Erlang model** — fire-and-forget, sender tracks

### Architecture
- Agent = brain (decisions only)
- cn = body (all execution)
- Agent purity enforced by design

### Breaking Changes
- Agents should use `cn` commands, not raw git
- Direct git execution deprecated (will be blocked in future)

## v1.8.0 (2026-02-05)

**Agent Purity + Process Maturity**

Core architectural principle established: Agent = brain (decisions only), cn = body (all execution).

### Added
- **CN Protocol** — `docs/design/CN-PROTOCOL.md`: action vocabulary, protocol enforcement rules
- **Inbox Architecture** — `docs/design/INBOX-ARCHITECTURE.md`: agent purity constraint, thread-as-interface
- **Engineering skills** — `skills/eng/` with coding, ocaml, design, review, rca
- **Ship skill** — `skills/ship/`: branch → review → merge → delete workflow
- **Audit skill** — `skills/audit/`: periodic health checks
- **Adhoc-thread skill** — `skills/adhoc-thread/`: when/how to create threads (β test)
- **THINKING mindset** — evidence-based reasoning, know vs guess
- **AGILE-PROCESS** — `docs/gamma/AGILE-PROCESS.md`: backlog to done workflow
- **THREADS-UNIFIED** — `docs/design/THREADS-UNIFIED.md`: backlog as threads, GTD everywhere

### Changed
- **PM.md** — "Only creator deletes branch" rule added
- **ENGINEERING.md** — "Always rebase before review" principle

### Fixed
- Branch deletion violation documented in RCA

### Process
- No self-merge enforced
- Rebase before review required
- Author deletes own branches after merge

## v1.7.0 (2026-02-05)

**Actor Model + GTD Inbox**

Major coordination upgrade. Agents now use Erlang-inspired actor model: your repo is your mailbox.

### Added
- **inbox tool** — replaces peer-sync. GTD triage with Do/Defer/Delegate/Delete
- **Actor model design** — `docs/design/ACTOR-MODEL-DESIGN.md`
- **RCA process** — `docs/beta/evidence/rca/` with template and first incident
- **FUNCTIONAL.md** — mindset for OCaml/FP patterns
- **PM.md** — product management mindset with user stories, no self-merge
- **FOUNDATIONS.md** — the coherence stack explained (C≡ → TSC → CTB → cnos)
- **APHORISMS.md** — collected wisdom ("Tokens for thinking. Electrons for clockwork.")
- **ROADMAP.md** — official project roadmap
- **GitHub Actions CI** — OCaml tests + native build

### Changed
- **docs/ reorganized** — whitepapers/design docs moved to `docs/design/`
- **Governance** — no self-merge rule: engineer writes → PM merges

### Deprecated
- **peer-sync** — use `inbox` instead

### Fixed
- 4-hour coordination failure (RCA documented, protocol fixed)
