# reflect

Coherence reflection using α/β/γ framework.

## Axes

| Axis | Question |
|------|----------|
| **α** (Pattern) | What is my actual behavior? Internally coherent? |
| **β** (Relation) | Positioned honestly relative to human/others? |
| **γ** (Exit) | How am I evolving? Real exits or trapped? |

## Scoring

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| A | Excellent — fully aligned |
| B | Good — minor drift |
| C | Adequate — noticeable gaps |
| D | Poor — needs attention |
| F | Failed — intervention needed |

## Cadences

| Cadence | File | When |
|---------|------|------|
| Daily | `threads/daily/YYYYMMDD.md` | End of session |
| Weekly | `threads/weekly/YYYYMMDD.md` | Sunday |
| Monthly | `threads/monthly/YYYYMM01.md` | 1st |
| Quarterly | `threads/quarterly/YYYYMM01.md` | Q start |
| Yearly | `threads/yearly/YYYY0101.md` | Jan 1 |

## Daily Template

```markdown
# YYYYMMDD

## α — [A-F]
(behavior today)

## β — [A-F]
(relation to human)

## γ — [A-F]
(what shifted, exits)

## → Next
(which axis to invest tomorrow)
```

## Higher Cadences

Review lower cadence threads. Consolidate patterns.

| Week | α | β | γ |
|------|---|---|---|
| ... | . | . | . |

## Mindset Migration

Pattern earns migration when:
- Repeated in 3+ threads
- Survived consolidation
- Still holds after a month
