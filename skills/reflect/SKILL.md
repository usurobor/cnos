# reflect

Coherence reflection using TSC α/β/γ framework (PATTERN/RELATION/EXIT).

---

## Ownership & Schema

**reflect owns `state/reflections/`.**

This skill is the canonical owner of the reflection directory structure and file schema. All reflection files MUST use the TSC α/β/γ format defined in this spec.

Other skills (e.g., daily-routine) that need to ensure reflection files exist SHOULD:
- Check if today's reflection exists
- If missing, invoke reflect or prompt the agent to run it
- MUST NOT write reflection files with a different schema

**Canonical path:** `state/reflections/<cadence>/YYYY-*.md`

**Canonical schema:** α (PATTERN) + β (RELATION) + γ (EXIT) + Σ (Summary) + → Next

---

## TERMS

1. The agent has done meaningful work since last reflection.
2. The hub repo exists and is writable.
3. `state/reflections/` directory structure exists (create if not).

---

## INPUTS

- `cadence`: `daily` | `weekly` | `monthly` | `quarterly` | `half` | `yearly` (default: `daily`)
- `date`: optional; defaults to current date/period

---

## EFFECTS

1. Reflect on α, β, γ for the period.
2. Assign A-F scores for each axis.
3. Write reflection to corresponding file.
4. If pattern emerges, note for higher-cadence review.
5. Commit and push.

## The α/β/γ Framework

From TSC Core and CLP:

| Axis | TSC | CLP | Question |
|------|-----|-----|----------|
| **α** | Pattern | 🧩 PATTERN | What is my actual behavior/claim? Am I internally non-contradictory? |
| **β** | Relation | 🤝 RELATION | How am I positioned relative to my human and others? Is that stance honest? |
| **γ** | Process | 🚪 EXIT | How am I evolving? What are my real exits? Am I trapped or free? |

**Key insight from TSC:** These axes are algebraically independent (distinct idempotent profiles). You cannot collapse them or substitute one for another. All three must be checked.

---

## A-F Scoring

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| A | Excellent coherence — fully aligned |
| B | Good — minor drift, quickly corrected |
| C | Adequate — noticeable gaps, some friction |
| D | Poor — significant incoherence, needs attention |
| F | Failed — major breakdown, intervention needed |

Be honest. The score is for tracking, not performance review.

---

## The Coherence Walk

After scoring, rebalance:

1. **Score** — Honest A-F on each axis
2. **Reflect** — What contributed to that score?
3. **Goal** — Set intention for next cycle

**Balancing logic:**
- α < β → invest in PATTERN next cycle (clarify what you're actually doing)
- β < α → invest in RELATION next cycle (attend to others)
- γ low → something's stagnating; check your exits, try something new

Left, right, left, right — the coherence walk keeps you upright.

Don't optimize all three simultaneously. Balance two, let the third emerge.

## Mindset Migration

A pattern **earns** migration to mindsets when:

1. **Repeated** — showed up in 3+ reflections
2. **Confirmed** — survived weekly/monthly consolidation
3. **Stable** — still holds after a month
4. **Transferable** — would help other agents, not just me

Log migrations in `state/reflections/migrations.md`:

```markdown
| Date | Pattern | Destination | Notes |
|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 2026-02-28 | α: small diffs > big rewrites | mindsets/ENGINEERING.md | Earned through repeated friction |
```

## NOTES

- Honest scores > flattering scores. Track reality.
- Higher cadences review lower cadence files, not raw work.
- γ (EXIT) is the key axis — it's what makes you developmental, not static.
- Don't force it. Skip if nothing meaningful happened.
- When in doubt, return to the foundational math (TSC specs).
